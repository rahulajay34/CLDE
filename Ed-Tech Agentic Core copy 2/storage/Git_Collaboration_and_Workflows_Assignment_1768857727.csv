mcsc,markdown,Which Git workflow is best suited for a team project with multiple developers working on different features?,,,,,,2,,Centralized Workflow,Feature Branch Workflow,Forking Workflow,Rebasing Workflow,,,Medium,"The Forking Workflow is best suited for a team project with multiple developers. It allows each developer to work on their own feature branch, which can then be merged back into the main branch through pull requests. This workflow promotes collaboration and parallel development."
mcsc,markdown,What is the primary purpose of merging branches in a Git workflow?,,,,,,1,,To combine the changes from two different branches into a single branch,To create a new branch from an existing one,To delete a branch that is no longer needed,To rewrite the commit history of a branch,,,Medium,The primary purpose of merging branches in a Git workflow is to combine the changes from two different branches into a single branch. This allows developers to integrate their work and keep the codebase up-to-date.
mcsc,markdown,What is the recommended approach for resolving conflicts when merging branches in a Git workflow?,,,,,,1,,Manually edit the conflicting files and choose the changes to keep,Discard all changes from the branch being merged and keep the changes in the current branch,Use the 'git merge --abort' command to cancel the merge and start over,Automatically accept the changes from the branch being merged,,,Medium,The recommended approach for resolving conflicts when merging branches in a Git workflow is to manually edit the conflicting files and choose the changes to keep. This allows you to carefully review the differences and make an informed decision about which changes to incorporate into the final merged version.
mcmc,markdown,Which of the following are valid reasons to create a new branch in a Git repository?,,,,,,,,To isolate work on a new feature,To fix a bug in the main codebase,To experiment with a risky change,To collaborate with another team member,"0, 1, 2",,Medium,"Creating a new branch allows you to isolate your work and experiment with changes without affecting the main codebase. This is useful for developing new features, fixing bugs, and trying out risky changes. Collaborating with others on a shared branch is also a common reason to create a new branch."
mcmc,markdown,What are the key steps to resolve a merge conflict in Git?,,,,,,,,Manually edit the conflicting files to choose the correct changes,Use the Git merge tool to visually compare and select the desired changes,Discard all changes and revert to the previous commit,Commit the merged changes and push to the remote repository,"0, 1",,Medium,"To resolve a merge conflict, you need to manually edit the conflicting files to choose the correct changes to keep. You can also use a Git merge tool like the one in your IDE to visually compare the changes and select the desired version. Discarding all changes is not recommended, and you should not commit the merged changes until the conflict is fully resolved."
mcmc,markdown,Which of the following are best practices for collaborating on a team project using GitHub?,,,,,,,,Regularly pull the latest changes from the remote repository,Create a new branch for each new feature or bug fix,Avoid making direct commits to the main branch,Merge your branch into the main branch as soon as your work is complete,"0, 1, 2",,Medium,"To effectively collaborate on a team project using GitHub, it's important to regularly pull the latest changes from the remote repository, create a new branch for each new feature or bug fix, and avoid making direct commits to the main branch. Merging your branch into the main branch should be done only after your work is complete and tested, not immediately."
subjective,markdown,Explain the purpose and benefits of using a branching workflow in a collaborative Git project.,,,,,,,"The purpose of a branching workflow in a collaborative Git project is to enable multiple developers to work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. This allows for parallel development and faster iteration. 

The key benefits include:
- Isolating changes: Developers can work on their own branches without affecting the main codebase until the changes are ready to be merged.
- Easier conflict resolution: Merging smaller, incremental changes is simpler than trying to resolve conflicts in a single large merge.
- Rollback capability: If a feature branch introduces issues, it can be discarded without impacting the main branch.
- Traceability: Branching provides a clear history of who worked on what and when, facilitating code reviews and debugging.
- Flexibility: Developers can experiment and try different approaches on their own branches without disrupting others.",,,,,,,Medium,"This question tests the understanding of branching workflows in collaborative Git projects. The model answer covers the key purposes and benefits, demonstrating a solid grasp of how branching enables parallel development, easier conflict resolution, and better traceability."
subjective,markdown,You are working on a team project using Git. Describe the steps you would take to resolve a merge conflict that arises when trying to merge your feature branch into the main branch.,,,,,,,"To resolve a merge conflict when trying to merge a feature branch into the main branch, I would follow these steps:

1. Identify the conflicting files: Git will mark the files with conflicts so I can see which ones need to be resolved.

2. Open the conflicting files: I will open the files in a text editor to see the conflicting changes. Git will have inserted markers like '<<<<<<< HEAD' and '>>>>>>> feature-branch' to delineate the differences.

3. Manually edit the files: I will review the conflicting changes and decide which ones to keep. I will remove the Git conflict markers and manually edit the file contents to resolve the conflict.

4. Stage the resolved files: After resolving the conflicts in each file, I will add the edited files to the staging area using 'git add'.

5. Commit the merge: Once all conflicts are resolved, I will commit the merge using 'git commit'.

6. Push the merged branch: Finally, I will push the merged branch to the remote repository using 'git push'.

The key is to carefully review the conflicting changes, understand the context, and make informed decisions about which changes to keep in order to integrate the feature branch cleanly into the main codebase.",,,,,,,Medium,"This question tests the understanding of the steps required to resolve merge conflicts when merging a feature branch into the main branch in a collaborative Git project. The model answer covers the full process, from identifying conflicting files to manually editing them, staging the resolved files, committing the merge, and pushing the merged branch. This demonstrates a comprehensive grasp of the conflict resolution workflow."
