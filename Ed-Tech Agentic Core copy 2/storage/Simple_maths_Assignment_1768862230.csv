mcsc,markdown,What is the result of 12 + 8?,,,,,,1,,16,19,20,22,,,Medium,"12 + 8 = 20, so the correct answer is 20. The other options are incorrect because they do not represent the sum of 12 and 8."
mcsc,markdown,"If you have 15 apples and you give 7 away, how many apples do you have left?",,,,,,2,,5,8,10,15,,,Medium,"You started with 15 apples and gave away 7, so the number of apples you have left is 15 - 7 = 8."
mcsc,markdown,What is the result of 25 - 13?,,,,,,3,,8,10,12,15,,,Medium,"25 - 13 = 12, so the correct answer is 12. The other options are incorrect because they do not represent the difference between 25 and 13."
mcsc,markdown,"If you have 18 pencils and you buy 6 more, how many pencils do you have in total?",,,,,,3,,18,20,24,30,,,Medium,"You started with 18 pencils and bought 6 more, so the total number of pencils is 18 + 6 = 24."
mcsc,markdown,What is the result of 16 - 9?,,,,,,1,,5,7,9,16,,,Medium,"16 - 9 = 7, so the correct answer is 7. The other options are incorrect because they do not represent the difference between 16 and 9."
mcmc,markdown,What is the sum of 12 and 8?,,,,,,,,16,20,24,28,1,,Medium,"The correct answer is 20 because 12 + 8 = 20. The other options are incorrect because 16 is the sum of 8 and 8, 24 is the sum of 12 and 12, and 28 is the sum of 20 and 8."
mcmc,markdown,Which of these expressions correctly represent the subtraction of 15 from 25?,,,,,,,,25 - 15,15 - 25,25 + (-15),25 - (-15),"0, 2",,Medium,"The correct answers are '25 - 15' and '25 + (-15)' because both of these expressions correctly represent the subtraction of 15 from 25, which is 10. '15 - 25' is incorrect because it represents the subtraction of 25 from 15, which is -10. '25 - (-15)' is incorrect because it represents the addition of 15 to 25, which is 40."
mcmc,markdown,Which of these expressions correctly represent the addition of -3 and 7?,,,,,,,,-3 + 7,7 + (-3),-3 - 7,7 - (-3),"0, 1",,Medium,"The correct answers are '-3 + 7' and '7 + (-3)' because both of these expressions correctly represent the addition of -3 and 7, which is 4. '-3 - 7' is incorrect because it represents the subtraction of 7 from -3, which is -10. '7 - (-3)' is incorrect because it represents the addition of 3 to 7, which is 10."
mcmc,markdown,What is the result of subtracting 6 from 18?,,,,,,,,12,24,30,36,0,,Medium,"The correct answer is 12 because 18 - 6 = 12. The other options are incorrect because 24 is the result of adding 6 to 18, 30 is the result of adding 12 to 18, and 36 is the result of adding 18 to 18."
mcmc,markdown,Which of these expressions correctly represent the addition of 5 and -2?,,,,,,,,5 + (-2),5 - 2,-2 + 5,5 + 2,"0, 2",,Medium,"The correct answers are '5 + (-2)' and '-2 + 5' because both of these expressions correctly represent the addition of 5 and -2, which is 3. '5 - 2' is incorrect because it represents the subtraction of 2 from 5, which is 3. '5 + 2' is incorrect because it represents the addition of 5 and 2, which is 7."
subjective,markdown,Explain the steps to solve a two-digit subtraction problem with borrowing.,,,,,,,"To solve a two-digit subtraction problem with borrowing:
1. Line up the numbers vertically, with the ones digits aligned.
2. If the ones digit of the bottom number is larger than the ones digit of the top number, 'borrow' 1 ten from the top number.
3. Subtract the ones digits.
4. Subtract the tens digits, taking into account the 'borrowed' ten.
5. Write the final answer with the correct place values.",,,,,,,Medium,"This question tests the student's understanding of the step-by-step process for solving two-digit subtraction problems that require borrowing. The model answer outlines the key steps involved, including lining up the numbers, borrowing a ten, subtracting the ones and tens digits, and writing the final answer. This demonstrates the student's ability to apply the subtraction concept with the appropriate procedure."
subjective,markdown,Explain how to add two three-digit numbers with regrouping.,,,,,,,"To add two three-digit numbers with regrouping:
1. Line up the numbers vertically, with the ones digits aligned.
2. Add the ones digits, and if the sum is greater than 9, 'regroup' by carrying the ten to the tens column.
3. Add the tens digits, including any ten that was carried over.
4. If the tens digit sum is greater than 9, regroup by carrying the hundred to the hundreds column.
5. Add the hundreds digits, including any hundred that was carried over.
6. Write the final answer with the correct place values.",,,,,,,Medium,"This question assesses the student's understanding of the step-by-step process for adding two three-digit numbers that require regrouping. The model answer outlines the key steps, including lining up the numbers, adding the ones and tens digits while handling any regrouping, and writing the final answer with the correct place values. This demonstrates the student's ability to apply the addition concept with the appropriate procedure when dealing with larger numbers and regrouping."
