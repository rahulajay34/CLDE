mcsc,markdown,What is the sum of 12 and 15?,,,,,,2,,21,27,33,45,,,Medium,"To find the sum of two numbers, we add them together. 12 + 15 = 27, so the correct answer is 33."
mcsc,markdown,"If you have 8 apples and your friend gives you 6 more, how many apples do you have in total?",,,,,,3,,8,12,14,20,,,Medium,"You started with 8 apples, and your friend gave you 6 more. To find the total, we add 8 and 6, which equals 14."
mcsc,markdown,What is the result of adding 18 and 22?,,,,,,4,,30,35,40,45,,,Medium,"To add two numbers, we combine them together. 18 + 22 = 40, so the correct answer is 45."
mcmc,markdown,What are the two correct ways to add two single-digit numbers?,,,,,,,,Use a calculator,Count on your fingers,Memorize the addition facts,Add the digits together,"2, 3",,Medium,"The two correct ways to add two single-digit numbers are to memorize the addition facts (e.g. 3 + 4 = 7) or to add the digits together (e.g. 3 + 4 = 7). Using a calculator is not necessary for simple addition, and counting on fingers is a less efficient method once you have memorized the facts."
mcmc,markdown,Which of these strategies are effective for adding multi-digit numbers?,,,,,,,,Break the numbers into place values and add each place value separately,Use the standard algorithm (carrying and regrouping),Estimate the sum first and then calculate the exact answer,Multiply the numbers and then subtract,"0, 1",,Medium,"The two effective strategies for adding multi-digit numbers are 1) breaking the numbers into place values and adding each place value separately, and 2) using the standard algorithm with carrying and regrouping. Estimating the sum first is a good strategy, but not a complete method on its own. Multiplying and then subtracting is not an effective way to add multi-digit numbers."
mcmc,markdown,Which properties of addition can help you solve addition problems more efficiently?,,,,,,,,Commutative property,Associative property,Distributive property,Inverse property,"0, 1",,Medium,"The commutative property (a + b = b + a) and the associative property ((a + b) + c = a + (b + c)) can help you solve addition problems more efficiently by allowing you to rearrange the addends in a way that makes the calculation easier. The distributive property is for multiplication, not addition, and the inverse property refers to subtraction being the inverse of addition."
subjective,markdown,Explain the steps to solve a two-digit addition problem using the standard algorithm.,,,,,,,"To solve a two-digit addition problem using the standard algorithm:
1. Line up the numbers vertically, with the ones digits aligned.
2. Add the ones digits, carrying any tens if needed.
3. Add the tens digits, including any carried tens.
4. Write the final sum with the correct place value alignment.",,,,,,,Medium,"The key steps are aligning the place values, adding the digits in each place value, and properly carrying any tens to the next place. This systematic approach ensures the final sum is calculated correctly."
