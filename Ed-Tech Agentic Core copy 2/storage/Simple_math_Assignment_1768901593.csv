mcsc,markdown,"A bakery sold 127 cookies in the morning, 89 cookies in the afternoon, and 156 cookies in the evening. How many cookies did the bakery sell in total?",,,,,,2,,362 cookies,372 cookies,382 cookies,392 cookies,,,Medium,"To find the total number of cookies sold, we need to add all three amounts together. Starting with 127 + 89: we can break this down as 127 + 89 = 216. Now we add the evening sales: 216 + 156. Breaking this down: 216 + 156 = 372. Therefore, the bakery sold 372 cookies in total. Option 1 (362) is incorrect as it results from a calculation error. Option 3 (382) might result from misadding the ones or tens place. Option 4 (392) is too high and results from incorrect carrying during addition."
mcsc,markdown,"Maria has three savings jars. The first jar contains $245, the second jar contains $178, and the third jar contains $96. If she combines all the money from the three jars, how much money will she have?",,,,,,2,,$509,$519,$529,$539,,,Medium,"We need to add the amounts from all three jars: 245 + 178 + 96. First, let's add 245 + 178. Breaking it down by place value: 5 + 8 = 13 (write 3, carry 1), 4 + 7 + 1 = 12 (write 2, carry 1), 2 + 1 + 1 = 4, giving us 423. Now we add 96 to this result: 423 + 96. Again by place value: 3 + 6 = 9, 2 + 9 = 11 (write 1, carry 1), 4 + 0 + 1 = 5, giving us 519. Therefore, Maria will have $519 in total. Option 1 ($509) results from an error in adding the tens place. Option 3 ($529) and Option 4 ($539) result from incorrect carrying or place value errors."
mcmc,markdown,Which of the following expressions equal 15? Select all that apply.,,,,,,,,7 + 8,9 + 6,12 + 3,10 + 4,"1, 3",,Medium,"To find which expressions equal 15, we calculate each sum: 7 + 8 = 15 (correct), 9 + 6 = 15 (correct), 12 + 3 = 15 (correct), and 10 + 4 = 14 (incorrect). Therefore, the first three options are correct as they all sum to 15, while the fourth option gives 14."
mcmc,markdown,"A baker made 23 cookies in the morning and some more in the afternoon. If the total number of cookies is 45, which statements are true? Select all that apply.",,,,,,,,The baker made 22 cookies in the afternoon,The sum 23 + 22 equals the total cookies,The baker made 23 cookies in the afternoon,The difference between total cookies and morning cookies is 22,"1, 2, 4",,Medium,"First, we find how many cookies were made in the afternoon: 45 - 23 = 22 cookies. Now we evaluate each statement: Option 1 is correct because the baker made 22 cookies in the afternoon. Option 2 is correct because 23 + 22 = 45, which equals the total. Option 3 is incorrect because the baker made 22, not 23, cookies in the afternoon. Option 4 is correct because the difference 45 - 23 = 22 represents the afternoon cookies."
