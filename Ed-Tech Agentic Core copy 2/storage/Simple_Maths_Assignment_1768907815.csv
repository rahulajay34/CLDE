mcsc,markdown,"A store had 347 apples in the morning. During the day, they sold 128 apples and received a delivery of 95 more apples. How many apples does the store have now?",,,,,,1,,314 apples,220 apples,570 apples,442 apples,,,Medium,"Starting with 347 apples, we first subtract the 128 apples that were sold: 347 - 128 = 219. Then we add the 95 apples from the delivery: 219 + 95 = 314. Therefore, the store now has 314 apples. Option 2 (220) incorrectly calculates the first subtraction. Option 3 (570) adds all numbers instead of following the operations correctly. Option 4 (442) adds 95 first then subtracts 128, which gives the wrong order of operations for this real-world scenario."
mcsc,markdown,"Maria had some money. She spent $45 on groceries, then earned $60 from babysitting. After that, she spent $28 on a book. If she now has $112, how much money did Maria have initially?",,,,,,1,,$125,$99,$205,$145,,,Medium,"Let's work backwards from the final amount. Maria has $112 now. Before buying the book for $28, she had: 112 + 28 = 140. Before earning $60 from babysitting, she had: 140 - 60 = 80. Before spending $45 on groceries, she had: 80 + 45 = 125. Therefore, Maria initially had $125. Option 2 ($99) incorrectly subtracts instead of adds the initial grocery expense. Option 3 ($205) adds all amounts to the final total. Option 4 ($145) makes an error in one of the calculation steps."
mcmc,markdown,"A store had 245 apples in the morning. During the day, 78 apples were sold, then 56 more apples were delivered, and finally 34 apples were sold. Which of the following statements are correct about the apples?",,,,,,,,The store has 189 apples at the end of the day,The total number of apples sold during the day is 112,The store received more apples than it sold during the day,"If 50 more apples are sold, the store will have 139 apples left","1, 2, 4",,Medium,"Starting with 245 apples: First, 78 apples were sold, leaving 245 - 78 = 167 apples. Then 56 apples were delivered, giving 167 + 56 = 223 apples. Finally, 34 apples were sold, leaving 223 - 34 = 189 apples. Option 1 is correct: The store has 189 apples at the end. Option 2 is correct: Total apples sold = 78 + 34 = 112 apples. Option 3 is incorrect: The store received 56 apples but sold 112 apples, so it sold more than it received. Option 4 is correct: If 50 more apples are sold from 189, then 189 - 50 = 139 apples remain."
mcmc,markdown,Consider the equation: 156 + A - 89 = 124. Which of the following are true?,,,,,,,,The value of A is 57,"If we add 11 to both sides of the equation, A remains 57",The expression 156 - 89 equals 67,"If A is doubled, the left side of the equation equals 191","1, 2, 3",,Medium,"To find A, we solve: 156 + A - 89 = 124. First, simplify the left side: 156 - 89 = 67, so 67 + A = 124. Therefore, A = 124 - 67 = 57. Option 1 is correct: A = 57. Option 2 is correct: Adding the same value to both sides of an equation doesn't change the value of the variable, so A remains 57. Option 3 is correct: 156 - 89 = 67. Option 4 is incorrect: If A is doubled to 114, the left side becomes 156 + 114 - 89 = 181, not 191."
subjective,markdown,"A shopkeeper had 245 apples in the morning. During the day, he sold 87 apples, then received a delivery of 156 apples, and finally sold another 63 apples. How many apples does the shopkeeper have at the end of the day? Show all your steps.",,,,,,,"251 apples. Steps: Start with 245 apples, subtract 87 (245 - 87 = 158), add 156 (158 + 156 = 314), subtract 63 (314 - 63 = 251).",,,,,,,Medium,"To solve this problem, we need to track the changes in the number of apples step by step. Starting amount: 245 apples. First transaction: The shopkeeper sold 87 apples, so we subtract: 245 - 87 = 158 apples remaining. Second transaction: He received a delivery of 156 apples, so we add: 158 + 156 = 314 apples. Third transaction: He sold another 63 apples, so we subtract: 314 - 63 = 251 apples. Therefore, the shopkeeper has 251 apples at the end of the day. This problem requires combining multiple addition and subtraction operations in sequence, keeping track of the running total after each transaction."
subjective,markdown,"Maria is saving money for a bicycle that costs 450 dollars. She already has 178 dollars saved. Her grandmother gives her 95 dollars for her birthday, and she earns 62 dollars from doing chores. How much more money does Maria need to buy the bicycle? Explain your reasoning.",,,,,,,115 dollars. Reasoning: Total saved = 178 + 95 + 62 = 335 dollars. Amount needed = 450 - 335 = 115 dollars.,,,,,,,Medium,"This problem requires us to first calculate how much money Maria has in total, then determine how much more she needs. Step 1: Calculate Maria's total savings. She starts with 178 dollars, receives 95 dollars from her grandmother, and earns 62 dollars from chores. Total savings = 178 + 95 + 62. First, add 178 + 95 = 273. Then add 273 + 62 = 335 dollars. Step 2: Calculate how much more money she needs. The bicycle costs 450 dollars and she has 335 dollars. Amount needed = 450 - 335 = 115 dollars. Therefore, Maria needs 115 more dollars to buy the bicycle. This problem combines multiple additions to find a total, followed by a subtraction to find the difference between what she has and what she needs."
