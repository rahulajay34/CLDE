mcsc,markdown,What is the result of 25 + 37?,,,,,,1,,52,62,72,82,,,Medium,"To find the result of 25 + 37, we add the ones digits (5 + 7 = 12) and the tens digits (2 + 3 = 5). This gives us a result of 52."
mcsc,markdown,"If you have 45 apples and you give away 18, how many apples do you have left?",,,,,,2,,17,27,37,47,,,Medium,"To find the number of apples left, we need to subtract the number of apples given away (18) from the original number of apples (45). 45 - 18 = 27, so the correct answer is 27 apples left."
mcsc,markdown,What is the result of 63 - 28?,,,,,,2,,25,35,45,55,,,Medium,"To find the result of 63 - 28, we subtract the ones digits (3 - 8 = -5) and the tens digits (6 - 2 = 4). This gives us a result of 35."
mcmc,markdown,What is the result of adding 25 and 37?,,,,,,,,52,62,72,82,0,,Medium,"The correct answer is 52, which is the result of adding 25 and 37. The other options are incorrect because they do not represent the sum of 25 and 37."
mcmc,markdown,Which of the following expressions represent subtraction?,,,,,,,,25 + 37,25 - 37,25 * 37,25 / 37,1,,Medium,"The correct answer is '25 - 37', which represents subtraction. The other options represent addition, multiplication, and division, respectively, and are not correct."
mcmc,markdown,What is the result of subtracting 45 from 78?,,,,,,,,23,33,43,53,0,,Medium,"The correct answer is 23, which is the result of subtracting 45 from 78. The other options are incorrect because they do not represent the difference between 78 and 45."
subjective,markdown,Explain the steps to solve a two-digit subtraction problem with borrowing.,,,,,,,"To solve a two-digit subtraction problem with borrowing:
1. Line up the numbers vertically, with the ones digit under the ones digit and the tens digit under the tens digit.
2. Compare the ones digits. If the bottom number is larger than the top number, 'borrow' 1 ten from the top number's tens digit.
3. Subtract the ones digits.
4. Subtract the tens digits, taking into account the 'borrowed' ten.
5. Write the final answer with the tens digit on top and the ones digit on bottom.",,,,,,,Medium,"This response demonstrates a clear understanding of the step-by-step process to solve a two-digit subtraction problem that requires borrowing. The explanation covers lining up the numbers, comparing the ones digits, borrowing from the tens digit, subtracting the ones and then the tens, and writing the final answer. This level of detail is appropriate for a medium difficulty subjective question on basic subtraction."
subjective,markdown,Explain how to add two three-digit numbers that require regrouping in both the ones and tens places.,,,,,,,"To add two three-digit numbers that require regrouping in both the ones and tens places:
1. Line up the numbers vertically, with the ones digit under the ones digit, the tens digit under the tens digit, and the hundreds digit under the hundreds digit.
2. Add the ones digits. If the sum is 10 or greater, 'regroup' by carrying 1 ten to the tens column.
3. Add the tens digits, including any ten that was carried over from the ones column. If the sum is 10 or greater, regroup by carrying 1 hundred to the hundreds column.
4. Add the hundreds digits, including any hundred that was carried over from the tens column.
5. Write the final answer with the hundreds digit on top, then the tens digit, and the ones digit on the bottom.",,,,,,,Medium,"This response outlines the complete step-by-step process for adding two three-digit numbers that require regrouping in both the ones and tens places. It covers lining up the numbers, adding the ones and tens digits while regrouping as necessary, and then adding the hundreds digits. The level of detail provided is appropriate for a medium difficulty subjective question on multi-digit addition with regrouping."
