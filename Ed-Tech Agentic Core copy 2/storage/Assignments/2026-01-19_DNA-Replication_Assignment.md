    "Question": "What is the primary function of the helicase enzyme during DNA replication?",
    "Options": "A) To unwind the double-stranded DNA helix\nB) To synthesize new DNA strands\nC) To proofread and correct errors in the newly synthesized DNA\nD) To provide energy for the replication process",
    "Correct Answer": "A",
    "Explanation": "Helicase is responsible for unwinding the double-stranded DNA helix, creating the replication fork where DNA synthesis can occur. It uses the energy from ATP hydrolysis to separate the two DNA strands, allowing access for other replication enzymes.",

    "Question": "Which DNA polymerase enzyme is responsible for synthesizing the leading strand during DNA replication?",
    "Options": "A) DNA polymerase α\nB) DNA polymerase β\nC) DNA polymerase γ\nD) DNA polymerase ε",
    "Correct Answer": "D",
    "Explanation": "DNA polymerase ε is the primary enzyme responsible for synthesizing the leading strand during DNA replication. It has high processivity and can continuously replicate the leading strand in the 5' to 3' direction.",

  {
    "Question": "What is the primary difference between the leading and lagging strands during DNA replication?",
    "Options": "A) The leading strand is synthesized continuously, while the lagging strand is synthesized in short, discontinuous fragments.\nB) The leading strand is synthesized in the 3' to 5' direction, while the lagging strand is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction.\nC) The leading strand is synthesized by DNA polymerase α, while the lagging strand is synthesized by DNA polymerase ε.\nD) The leading strand is synthesized on the 3' side of the replication fork, while the lagging strand is synthesized on the 5' side.",
    "Correct Answer": "A",
    "Explanation": "The leading strand is synthesized continuously in the 5' to 3' direction, while the lagging strand is synthesized in short, discontinuous fragments called Okazaki fragments. This is due to the inherent 5' to 3' directionality of DNA synthesis and the need to replicate the two antiparallel DNA strands.",

    "Question": "Which DNA polymerase enzyme is responsible for synthesizing the lagging strand during DNA replication?",
    "Options": "A) DNA polymerase α\nB) DNA polymerase β\nC) DNA polymerase γ\nD) DNA polymerase δ",
    "Correct Answer": "A",
    "Explanation": "DNA polymerase α is the primary enzyme responsible for synthesizing the lagging strand during DNA replication. It initiates the synthesis of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand, which are then extended by DNA polymerase δ.",

    "Question": "Explain how the leading and lagging strands are coordinated during DNA replication.",
    "Options": "A) The leading strand is synthesized continuously, while the lagging strand is synthesized in short, discontinuous fragments.\nB) The leading strand is synthesized by DNA polymerase ε, while the lagging strand is synthesized by DNA polymerase α.\nC) The leading strand is synthesized on the 3' side of the replication fork, while the lagging strand is synthesized on the 5' side.\nD) The leading strand is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction, while the lagging strand is synthesized in the 3' to 5' direction.",
    "Correct Answer": "A",
    "Explanation": "The leading strand is synthesized continuously in the 5' to 3' direction, while the lagging strand is synthesized in short, discontinuous fragments called Okazaki fragments. This is due to the inherent 5' to 3' directionality of DNA synthesis and the need to replicate the two antiparallel DNA strands. The discontinuous synthesis of the lagging strand is coordinated with the continuous synthesis of the leading strand to ensure the complete replication of the DNA molecule.",
