    "Question": "Which of the following best describes the wave-particle duality of light and matter?",
    "Options": "A) Light and matter can only exhibit particle-like or wave-like behavior, but not both.\nB) Light and matter always exhibit both particle-like and wave-like properties simultaneously.\nC) Light exhibits wave-like properties, while matter exhibits particle-like properties.\nD) The wave-like or particle-like behavior of light and matter depends on the experimental setup.",
    "Correct Answer": "D",
    "Explanation": "The wave-particle duality states that light and matter can exhibit both particle-like and wave-like properties, and the observed behavior depends on the experimental setup. This means that the same entity can behave as a particle in one experiment and as a wave in another.",

    "Question": "What is the primary purpose of the Schrödinger equation in quantum mechanics?",
    "Options": "A) To determine the probability distribution of a particle's position and momentum.\nB) To describe the motion of a classical particle under the influence of a potential.\nC) To calculate the energy levels of an atom or molecule.\nD) To predict the outcome of a quantum measurement with certainty.",
    "Correct Answer": "A",

    "Question": "Which of the following best describes the Heisenberg uncertainty principle?",
    "Options": "A) It is impossible to know the position and momentum of a particle simultaneously with absolute precision.\nB) It is impossible to measure the position and momentum of a particle without disturbing the system.\nC) It is impossible to know the energy and time of a particle simultaneously with absolute precision.\nD) All of the above.",
    "Correct Answer": "D",
    "Explanation": "The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, such as position and momentum or energy and time, can be known simultaneously. This means that it is impossible to know the position and momentum of a particle with absolute precision, and it is also impossible to measure these quantities without disturbing the system.",

    "Correct Answer": "A",
    "Explanation": "The probability density |Ψ(x,t)|^2 represents the probability of finding the particle at a specific position x at time t. This is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, where the wave function Ψ(x,t) determines the probability distribution of the particle's position.",

    "Correct Answer": "D",
    "Explanation": "The wave-particle duality of matter has several important consequences, including the ability to observe electron diffraction in double-slit experiments (demonstrating the wave-like nature of matter), the existence of discrete energy levels in atoms and molecules (a consequence of the wave-like behavior), and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (which limits the simultaneous measurement of position and momentum).",

    "Question": "Imagine a particle is confined to a one-dimensional box with impenetrable walls. Which of the following is true about the particle's energy levels in this scenario?",
    "Options": "A) The energy levels are continuous and can take on any value.\nB) The energy levels are quantized and can only take on discrete values.\nC) The energy levels depend only on the mass of the particle, not the size of the box.\nD) There is only a single allowed energy level for the particle.",
    "Correct Answer": "B",
    "Explanation": "When a particle is confined to a one-dimensional box with impenetrable walls, its energy levels become quantized, meaning they can only take on discrete values. This is a consequence of the wave-like nature of the particle and the boundary conditions imposed by the box. The specific energy levels depend on the size of the box and the mass of the particle.",

    "Correct Answer": "D",
    "Explanation": "If the particle's wave function is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian operator, then the particle's energy is equal to the eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian operator. This is a fundamental result in quantum mechanics, where the energy levels of a particle in a quantum system are determined by the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator.",

    "Correct Answer": "C",
    "Explanation": "When a particle is in a superposition of two energy eigenstates, the measurement of its energy will result in one of the two energy eigenvalues, with probabilities determined by the coefficients of the superposition.
