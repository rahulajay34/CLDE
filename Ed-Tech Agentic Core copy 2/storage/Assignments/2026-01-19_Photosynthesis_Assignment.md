    "Question": "What is the primary function of the light-dependent reactions in photosynthesis?",
    "Options": "A) To convert carbon dioxide into glucose\nB) To produce ATP and NADPH\nC) To release oxygen as a byproduct\nD) All of the above",
    "Correct Answer": "B) To produce ATP and NADPH",
    "Explanation": "The light-dependent reactions in photosynthesis use the energy from sunlight to produce ATP and NADPH, which are then used in the Calvin cycle to convert carbon dioxide into glucose. The light-dependent reactions do not directly produce glucose, but rather provide the energy and reducing power needed for the Calvin cycle.",

    "Correct Answer": "D) All of the above",
    "Explanation": "The key steps in the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis include:
1) The splitting of water molecules (photolysis) to release electrons, protons, and oxygen as a byproduct.
2) The reduction of NADP+ to NADPH, which provides the reducing power for the Calvin cycle.

    "Correct Answer": "D) Both A and B are true",
    "Explanation": "Chlorophyll is the primary pigment involved in the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. It absorbs specific wavelengths of visible light, particularly red and blue light, and transfers the energy to the electron transport chain to drive the production of ATP and NADPH. Chlorophyll is also responsible for the characteristic green color of plants and algae, as it reflects green wavelengths of light while absorbing other visible wavelengths.",

    "Explanation": "The thylakoid membrane system within a chloroplast is the site of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. The thylakoid membranes contain the photosynthetic pigments, such as chlorophyll, and the components of the electron transport chain that drive the production of ATP and NADPH.
