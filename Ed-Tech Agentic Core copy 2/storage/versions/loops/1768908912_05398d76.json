The solution involves two loops:\\n\\n**Outer Loop Control:**\\nThe outer loop iterates through values 1 to 5, where each iteration represents one row of the pattern. The loop variable `i` serves a dual purpose: it determines both which number to print and how many times to print it.\\n\\n**Inner Loop Control:**\\nThe inner loop executes `i` times for each value of the outer loop. When `i=1`, the inner loop runs once; when `i=2`, it runs twice; and so on. This creates the increasing pattern.\\n\\n**Print Logic:**\\n- Inside the inner loop, we print the value of `i` (not `j`) because we want to print the row number, not the column position.\\n- We use `end=' '` to print numbers on the same line separated by spaces.\\n- After the inner loop completes all iterations for a given row, we print a newline character to move to the next row.\\n\\n**Step-by-step execution:**\\n- Row 1: i=1, inner loop runs 1 time, prints '1'\\n- Row 2: i=2, inner loop runs 2 times, prints '2 2'\\n- Row 3: i=3, inner loop runs 3 times, prints '3 3 3'\\n- Row 4: i=4, inner loop runs 4 times, prints '4 4 4 4'\\n- Row 5: i=5, inner loop runs 5 times, prints '5 5 5 5 5'\\n\\nThe key insight is that the outer loop variable controls both what to print and how many times the inner loop should iterate, demonstrating the power of nested loop coordination.\",\n    \"difficulty\": \"Medium\",\n    \"type\": \"subjective\"\n  }\n]",
