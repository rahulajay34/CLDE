This means that particles like electrons, photons, and atoms can behave as both particles and waves, depending on the experiment being conducted. This challenges our classical understanding of the nature of matter and energy, which typically treats them as distinct and separate phenomena. The wave-particle duality suggests that at the quantum level, the distinction between particles and waves breaks down, and the behavior of these entities is better described by a unified wave-particle model. The Schr\\u00f6dinger equation is a key mathematical framework that describes this wave-particle duality and allows for the prediction of the behavior of quantum systems.\",\n    \"explanation\": \"This question tests the student's understanding of the wave-particle duality concept and how it challenges classical physics.
