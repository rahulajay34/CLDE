This directly selects the element with the specified ID. The other options are incorrect - `document.getElementsByClassName('main-content')` would select elements with the class 'main-content', `document.querySelector('#main-content')` would select the first element matching the CSS selector '#main-content', and `document.querySelectorAll('#main-content')` would select all elements matching the CSS selector '#main-content'.\",\n    \"difficulty\": \"Medium\",\n    \"type\": \"mcsc\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question_text\": \"How can you change the text content of an element with the ID 'message' using JavaScript?\",\n    \"options\": [\n      \"document.getElementById('message').innerHTML = 'New text'\",\n      \"document.getElementById('message').textContent = 'New text'\",\n      \"document.getElementById('message').value = 'New text'\",\n      \"document.getElementById('message').setAttribute('text', 'New text')\"\n    ],\n    \"correct_option_index\": 2,\n    \"explanation\": \"The correct way to change the text content of an element is to use the `textContent` property, like `document.getElementById('message').textContent = 'New text'`. This will replace the existing text content of the element with the new text. The `innerHTML` option would also work, but it is less preferred as it could introduce security risks if the new text contains HTML. The `value` option is for form elements like `<input>` or `<textarea>`, and the `setAttribute` option is for changing element attributes, not text content.\",\n    \"difficulty\": \"Medium\",\n    \"type\": \"mcsc\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question_text\": \"Which of the following are true about the Document Object Model (DOM)?\",\n    \"options\": [\n      \"The DOM represents the structure of an HTML document as a tree-like hierarchy of nodes\",\n      \"The DOM allows JavaScript to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a web page\",\n      \"The DOM is a platform-independent API that works the same way across all web browsers\",\n      \"The DOM is a static representation of the HTML document that cannot be modified at runtime\"\n    ],\n    \"correct_option_indices\": [\n      0,\n      1\n    ],\n    \"explanation\": \"The DOM represents the HTML document as a tree-like hierarchy of nodes, allowing JavaScript to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a web page.

It allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document. The DOM is crucial in web development because it:\\n\\n1. Enables interaction: The DOM allows developers to manipulate the elements on a web page, such as adding, removing, or modifying content, in response to user actions or other events.\\n\\n2. Facilitates dynamic content: By accessing and modifying the DOM, developers can create dynamic and interactive web pages that can change their appearance and behavior without requiring a full page refresh.\\n\\n3. Supports cross-browser compatibility: The DOM provides a standardized way to interact with web documents, allowing developers to write code that works consistently across different web browsers.\\n\\n4. Enhances user experience: The ability to dynamically update the DOM enables the creation of smooth, responsive, and engaging user interfaces that enhance the overall user experience.\\n\\nOverall, the DOM is a fundamental component of modern web development, as it allows developers to create dynamic, interactive, and responsive web applications that provide a seamless and engaging user experience.\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The explanation covers the key purposes and importance of the DOM in web development, including enabling interaction with web page elements, facilitating dynamic content, supporting cross-browser compatibility, and enhancing the user experience.

Provide examples of common DOM manipulation techniques.\",\n    \"model_answer\": \"Selecting and traversing DOM elements using JavaScript involves the following steps:\\n\\n1. Selecting elements:\\n   - Using single-element selectors like `document.getElementById()`, `document.querySelector()`, or `document.getElementsByTagName()`\\n   - Using multi-element selectors like `document.getElementsByClassName()` or `document.querySelectorAll()`\\n\\n2. Traversing the DOM:\\n   - Navigating up the DOM tree using `parentNode`, `parentElement`, or `closest()`\\n   - Navigating down the DOM tree using `children`, `firstElementChild`, `lastElementChild`, or `querySelectorAll()`\\n   - Navigating sideways using `previousElementSibling` or `nextElementSibling`\\n\\n3. Common DOM manipulation techniques:\\n   - Modifying element content using `textContent` or `innerHTML`\\n   - Changing element attributes using `getAttribute()`, `setAttribute()`, or `removeAttribute()`\\n   - Adding or removing elements using `createElement()`, `appendChild()`, `insertBefore()`, or `removeChild()`\\n   - Modifying element styles using the `style` property\\n   - Attaching event listeners using `addEventListener()` or `removeEventListener()`\\n\\nExamples:\\n- Selecting an element by its ID: `const myElement = document.getElementById('myId');`\\n- Traversing to the parent element: `const parentElement = myElement.parentElement;`\\n- Modifying the text content: `myElement.textContent = 'New text';`\\n- Adding a new element: `const newElement = document.createElement('div'); myElement.appendChild(newElement);`\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The explanation covers the key steps involved in selecting and traversing DOM elements using JavaScript, as well as common DOM manipulation techniques with examples.
