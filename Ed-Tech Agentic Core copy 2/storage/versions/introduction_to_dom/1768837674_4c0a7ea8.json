Techniques for changing the content and attributes of DOM elements\n\n## Understanding the DOM\n\n### What Is the DOM?\n\nWebpages are made up of different elements like text, images, and buttons. The Document Object Model (DOM) is how these elements are organized and connected on a webpage.\n\nThe DOM is a programming interface that allows software like web browsers to access and manipulate the content, structure, and style of a webpage. It represents the entire webpage as a hierarchical tree of elements, where each element can have its own properties and methods.\n\n### Why Does the DOM Matter?\n\nThe DOM is essential because:\n\n1. It allows you to dynamically change what users see on a webpage, without having to reload the entire page.\n2. It gives you fine-grained control over webpage elements, so you can make them do exactly what you want.\n3. It's the foundation for modern web programming\u2014without the DOM, interactive websites and web apps wouldn't be possible.\n\n### Core Components of the DOM\n\nThe three core components of the DOM are:\n\n1. **Nodes**: The basic building blocks, representing HTML elements, text, attributes, and more.\n2. **Trees**: The hierarchical structure that connects all the nodes, like a family tree.\n3. **Methods and Properties**: The tools you can use to navigate, select, and manipulate the nodes and trees.\n\n### Step-by-Step: Selecting DOM Elements\n\n1. Select an element by its unique ID using the `document.getElementById()` method.\n2. Select all elements of a certain HTML tag using `document.getElementsByTagName()`.\n3. Select elements that share a CSS class using `document.getElementsByClassName()`.\n4. Select elements based on CSS selectors using `document.querySelector()` and `document.querySelectorAll()`.\n\n### Putting It All Together\n\nFor example, on a webpage with a heading, paragraph, and button, you could use the DOM to:\n\n1. Select the heading by its ID and change the text: `const heading = document.getElementById('main-heading'); heading.textContent = 'Welcome to my webpage';`\n2. Select all the paragraphs and change their color: `const paragraphs = document.getElementsByTagName('p'); for (let p of paragraphs) { p.style.color = 'blue'; }`\n3. Select the button by its CSS class and add a click event: `const button = document.querySelector('.my-button'); button.addEventListener('click', () => alert('Button clicked!'));`\n\n## Questions to Try\n\n1. **Pattern Recognition**: Given the following HTML code:\n\n   ```html\n   <div id=\"container\">\n     <h1>My Webpage</h1>\n     <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>\n     <button class=\"btn\">Click me</button>\n   </div>\n   ```\n\n   How would you use the DOM to change the text of the heading and the button?\n\n2. **Concept Detective**: Describe the purpose of the following DOM methods:\n   - `document.getElementById()`\n   - `document.getElementsByTagName()`\n   - `document.querySelector()`\n\n3. **Real-Life Application**: Provide 3 examples of how the DOM could be used to improve a webpage or web application.\n\n4. **Spot the Error**: Identify the issue with the following code:\n   ```javascript\n   const allParagraphs = document.getElementsByTagName('p');\n   allParagraphs.textContent = 'New paragraph text';\n   ```\n\n5. **Planning Ahead**: Describe how the DOM could be used to create a simple interactive webpage with a button that changes the background color when clicked.",
