Identify the conflicting files: Git will mark the files with conflicts so I can see which ones need to be resolved.\\n\\n2. Open the conflicting files: I will open the files in a text editor to see the conflicting changes. Git will have inserted markers like '<<<<<<< HEAD' and '>>>>>>> feature-branch' to delineate the differences.\\n\\n3. Manually edit the files: I will review the conflicting changes and decide which ones to keep. I will remove the Git conflict markers and manually edit the file contents to resolve the conflict.\\n\\n4. Stage the resolved files: After resolving the conflicts in each file, I will add the edited files to the staging area using 'git add'.\\n\\n5. Commit the merge: Once all conflicts are resolved, I will commit the merge using 'git commit'.\\n\\n6. Push the merged branch: Finally, I will push the merged branch to the remote repository using 'git push'.\\n\\nThe key is to carefully review the conflicting changes, understand the context, and make informed decisions about which changes to keep in order to integrate the feature branch cleanly into the main codebase.\",\n    \"explanation\": \"This question tests the understanding of the steps required to resolve merge conflicts when merging a feature branch into the main branch in a collaborative Git project.
