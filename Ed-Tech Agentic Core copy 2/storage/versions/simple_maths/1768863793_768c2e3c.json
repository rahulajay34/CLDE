Later that day, a shipment of 425 new items arrived. How many items does the store have now?\",\n    \"options\": [\n      \"827 items\",\n      \"917 items\",\n      \"1,717 items\",\n      \"1,272 items\"\n    ],\n    \"correct_option_index\": 1,\n    \"explanation\": \"To solve this problem, we need to track the changes to inventory step by step. Starting with 847 items, we subtract the morning sales (847 - 256 = 591), then subtract the afternoon sales (591 - 189 = 402), and finally add the new shipment (402 + 425 = 827). Wait, let me recalculate: 847 - 256 = 591, then 591 - 189 = 402, then 402 + 425 = 827. Actually, the correct calculation is: Start: 847, After morning: 847 - 256 = 591, After afternoon: 591 - 189 = 402, After shipment: 402 + 425 = 827. However, option 1 shows 827, so the correct answer is 827 items. The other options result from common calculation errors: adding instead of subtracting at some steps, or making arithmetic mistakes in the multi-step process.\",\n    \"difficulty\": \"Medium\",\n    \"type\": \"mcsc\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question_text\": \"Maria has $1,250 in her savings account.

Starting balance: $1,250. After first withdrawal: $1,250 - $385 = $865. After deposit: $865 + $620 = $1,485. After second withdrawal: $1,485 - $175 = $1,310. The final balance is $1,310. Option 2 ($1,485) represents the balance before the final withdrawal. Option 3 ($930) results from subtracting all withdrawals but forgetting to add the deposit. Option 4 ($1,135) comes from calculation errors in the sequence of operations.\",\n    \"difficulty\": \"Medium\",\n    \"type\": \"mcsc\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question_text\": \"A parking lot has three sections.

First, find the number of cars in Section B: Section A has 156 cars, and Section B has 89 fewer, so Section B = 156 - 89 = 67 cars. Next, find Section C: Section C has 47 more cars than Section B, so Section C = 67 + 47 = 114 cars. The correct answer is 114 cars. Option 2 (203 cars) results from adding 47 to Section A instead of Section B. Option 3 (67 cars) is the number in Section B, not Section C. Option 4 (292 cars) comes from adding all the numbers together incorrectly.\",\n    \"difficulty\": \"Medium\",\n    \"type\": \"mcsc\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question_text\": \"Which of the following expressions equal 15?\",\n    \"options\": [\n      \"23 - 8\",\n      \"7 + 9\",\n      \"20 - 5\",\n      \"6 + 8\"\n    ],\n    \"correct_option_indices\": [\n      1,\n      3\n    ],\n    \"explanation\": \"Let's evaluate each expression:\\n\\n1. 23 - 8 = 15 \\u2713 (Correct: Subtracting 8 from 23 gives 15)\\n2. 7 + 9 = 16 \\u2717 (Incorrect: Adding 7 and 9 gives 16, not 15)\\n3. 20 - 5 = 15 \\u2713 (Correct: Subtracting 5 from 20 gives 15)\\n4. 6 + 8 = 14 \\u2717 (Incorrect: Adding 6 and 8 gives 14, not 15)\\n\\nTherefore, options 1 and 3 are correct as both equal 15.\",\n    \"difficulty\": \"Medium\",\n    \"type\": \"mcmc\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question_text\": \"A number is added to 12 to get 27.
