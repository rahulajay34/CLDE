For a blog post, we need elements that clearly identify the header area, main content, and footer.\\n\\n**Option 2 is correct** because it uses proper semantic HTML5 tags: `<header>` for the header section, `<main>` to wrap the primary content, `<article>` for the blog post content (which is self-contained and independently distributable), and `<footer>` for the footer section. This structure is both semantically meaningful and follows HTML5 best practices.\\n\\n**Option 1** uses generic `<div>` elements with class names. While this works functionally, it lacks semantic meaning\\u2014search engines and assistive technologies cannot understand the purpose of these sections without reading the class names.\\n\\n**Option 3** uses `<section>` elements with IDs, which is better than divs but still not optimal. The `<section>` tag is meant for thematic groupings of content, not for structural page elements like headers and footers.\\n\\n**Option 4** contains invalid HTML tags. `<head>` is for metadata (not visible content), `<content>` and `<foot>` are not valid HTML elements.\",\n    \"difficulty\": \"Medium\",\n    \"type\": \"mcsc\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question_text\": \"You need to create a registration form that requires a user's email and allows them to optionally upload a profile picture.
