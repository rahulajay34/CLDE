It plays a crucial role in unwinding the DNA double helix, creating a replication fork where DNA synthesis can occur. Helicase uses energy from ATP hydrolysis to actively separate the two strands of the DNA molecule, breaking the hydrogen bonds between the base pairs. This creates a 'bubble' or replication fork, exposing the single-stranded DNA templates for the DNA polymerase enzymes to bind and synthesize the new complementary strands.\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The question tests the student's understanding of the specific function of helicase in DNA replication and how it enables the replication process to proceed.

The leading strand is synthesized continuously in the 5' to 3' direction, moving in the same direction as the replication fork. In contrast, the lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously in short Okazaki fragments, with DNA polymerase moving in the opposite 3' to 5' direction. Okazaki fragments are then joined together by the enzyme DNA ligase. This difference in synthesis direction is due to the inherent 5' to 3' directionality of DNA polymerase. The leading strand can be synthesized continuously, while the lagging strand requires Okazaki fragments to be synthesized in the opposite direction and then ligated together.\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The question tests the student's understanding of the differences between leading and lagging strand synthesis during DNA replication, as well as the roles of DNA polymerase and Okazaki fragments in this process. The model answer provides a clear explanation of these key concepts.\",\n    \"difficulty\": \"Hard\",\n    \"type\": \"subjective\"\n  }\n]",
