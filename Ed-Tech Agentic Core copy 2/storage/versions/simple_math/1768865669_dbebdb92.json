First, add the stickers Sarah buys: 47 + 28 = 75. Then subtract the stickers she gives away: 75 - 15 = 60. The key is performing operations in the correct order. Option 2 (75) is incorrect because it stops after addition without subtracting. Option 3 (90) results from incorrectly adding all numbers.

Hmm, this seems coincidental. Let me recalculate properly: $85 - $32 = $53; $53 - $18 = $35; $35 + $50 = $85. The answer is $85, but that's option 2. Let me reconsider the problem setup. Actually, $85 - $32 - $18 + $50 = $85 is correct. I need to adjust: the correct answer should be $85 (option 2), not option 4.
