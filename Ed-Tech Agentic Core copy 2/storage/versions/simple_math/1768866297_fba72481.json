Hmm, this seems coincidental. Let me recalculate properly: $85 - $32 = $53; $53 - $18 = $35; $35 + $50 = $85. The answer is $85, but that's option 2. Let me reconsider the problem setup. Actually, $85 - $32 - $18 + $50 = $85 is correct. I need to adjust: the correct answer should be $85 (option 2), not option 4.

Option 3 is incorrect: 34 + 29 = 63 is wrong; the correct sum is 63 (34 + 30 = 64, minus 1 = 63, but let's verify: 34 + 29 = 34 + 20 + 9 = 54 + 9 = 63, actually this IS correct).
