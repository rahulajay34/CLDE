mcsc,markdown,What is the result of 15 + 27?,,,,,,1,,32,42,52,62,,,Medium,"To find the result of 15 + 27, we add the two numbers together. 15 + 27 = 42, so the correct answer is 42."
mcsc,markdown,"If you have 35 apples and you give 12 away, how many apples do you have left?",,,,,,2,,15,23,27,35,,,Medium,"To find the number of apples left, we start with 35 apples and subtract 12 apples that were given away. 35 - 12 = 23, so the correct answer is 23 apples left."
mcsc,markdown,What is the result of 48 - 19?,,,,,,2,,21,29,33,39,,,Medium,"To find the result of 48 - 19, we subtract 19 from 48. 48 - 19 = 29, so the correct answer is 29."
mcsc,markdown,"If you have 25 pencils and you buy 13 more, how many pencils do you have in total?",,,,,,3,,25,32,38,50,,,Medium,"To find the total number of pencils, we start with 25 pencils and add 13 more. 25 + 13 = 38, so the correct answer is 50 pencils in total."
mcsc,markdown,What is the result of 72 - 45?,,,,,,2,,17,27,37,45,,,Medium,"To find the result of 72 - 45, we subtract 45 from 72. 72 - 45 = 27, so the correct answer is 27."
mcmc,markdown,What is the sum of 12 and 8?,,,,,,,,16,20,24,28,1,,Medium,"The correct answer is 20 because 12 + 8 = 20. The other options are incorrect because 16 is the sum of 8 and 8, 24 is the sum of 12 and 12, and 28 is the sum of 20 and 8."
mcmc,markdown,Which of these expressions correctly represent the subtraction of 15 from 25?,,,,,,,,25 - 15,15 - 25,25 + (-15),25 - (-15),"0, 2",,Medium,"The correct answers are '25 - 15' and '25 + (-15)' because both of these expressions correctly represent the subtraction of 15 from 25, which is 10. '15 - 25' is incorrect because it represents the subtraction of 25 from 15, which is -10. '25 - (-15)' is incorrect because it represents the subtraction of the negative 15 from 25, which is 40."
mcmc,markdown,Which of these expressions correctly represent the addition of -3 and 7?,,,,,,,,-3 + 7,7 + (-3),-3 - 7,7 - (-3),"0, 1",,Medium,"The correct answers are '-3 + 7' and '7 + (-3)' because both of these expressions correctly represent the addition of -3 and 7, which is 4. '-3 - 7' is incorrect because it represents the subtraction of 7 from -3, which is -10. '7 - (-3)' is incorrect because it represents the subtraction of the negative 3 from 7, which is 10."
mcmc,markdown,What is the result of subtracting 6 from 12?,,,,,,,,3,6,12,18,0,,Medium,"The correct answer is 3 because 12 - 6 = 6. The other options are incorrect because 6 is the result of subtracting 6 from 6, 12 is the original number, and 18 is the result of adding 6 to 12."
mcmc,markdown,Which of these expressions correctly represent the addition of -5 and -3?,,,,,,,,-5 + (-3),-5 - 3,5 + (-3),5 - (-3),0,,Medium,"The correct answer is '-5 + (-3)' because this expression correctly represents the addition of -5 and -3, which is -8. The other options are incorrect because '-5 - 3' represents the subtraction of 3 from -5, which is -8, '5 + (-3)' represents the addition of -3 to 5, which is 2, and '5 - (-3)' represents the subtraction of the negative 3 from 5, which is 8."
subjective,markdown,Explain the steps to solve the equation 3x + 5 = 17.,,,,,,,"To solve the equation 3x + 5 = 17:
1. Subtract 5 from both sides to isolate the variable term: 3x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5
2. Simplify the left side: 3x = 12
3. Divide both sides by 3 to solve for x: 3x/3 = 12/3
4. The solution is x = 4.",,,,,,,Medium,"This question tests the student's ability to demonstrate the step-by-step process of solving a simple linear equation with one variable. The expected response should clearly show the logical progression from the original equation to the final solution, explaining each algebraic operation performed. The model answer provides a comprehensive walkthrough that covers all the key steps."
