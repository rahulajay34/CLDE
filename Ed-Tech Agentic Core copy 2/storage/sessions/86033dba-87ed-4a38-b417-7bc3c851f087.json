Starting with 127 + 89: we can break this down as 127 + 89 = 216. Now we add the evening sales: 216 + 156. Breaking this down: 216 + 156 = 372. Therefore, the bakery sold 372 cookies in total. Option 1 (362) is incorrect as it results from a calculation error. Option 3 (382) might result from misadding the ones or tens place. Option 4 (392) is too high and results from incorrect carrying during addition.\",\n    \"difficulty\": \"Medium\",\n    \"type\": \"mcsc\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question_text\": \"Maria has three savings jars.

First, let's add 245 + 178. Breaking it down by place value: 5 + 8 = 13 (write 3, carry 1), 4 + 7 + 1 = 12 (write 2, carry 1), 2 + 1 + 1 = 4, giving us 423. Now we add 96 to this result: 423 + 96. Again by place value: 3 + 6 = 9, 2 + 9 = 11 (write 1, carry 1), 4 + 0 + 1 = 5, giving us 519. Therefore, Maria will have $519 in total. Option 1 ($509) results from an error in adding the tens place.
