During photolysis in Photosystem II, water molecules are split into oxygen, protons (H\\u207a), and electrons. The oxygen atoms from water directly form the O\\u2082 gas that is released, so any isotopic label in the water's oxygen will appear in the released oxygen gas. This was actually proven through classic experiments by Samuel Ruben and Martin Kamen in the 1940s. The oxygen in glucose comes from CO\\u2082 during the Calvin cycle, not from water. The oxygen atoms in ATP come from phosphate groups already present in ADP, not from water splitting. NADPH receives hydrogen atoms (protons and electrons) from water, but not the oxygen atoms.\",\n    \"difficulty\": \"Medium\",\n    \"type\": \"mcsc\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question_text\": \"Which of the following statements correctly describe the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis?\",\n    \"options\": [\n      \"Photosystem II splits water molecules to release oxygen gas and provide electrons to the electron transport chain\",\n      \"ATP synthase uses the proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane to generate ATP through chemiosmosis\",\n      \"Carbon dioxide is fixed into organic molecules during the light-dependent reactions\",\n      \"NADP+ is reduced to NADPH by accepting electrons at the end of the electron transport chain\"\n    ],\n    \"correct_option_indices\": [\n      1,\n      2,\n      4\n    ],\n    \"explanation\": \"Options 1, 2, and 4 are correct.

Option 2 is correct because ATP synthase harnesses the proton-motive force created by the accumulation of H\\u207a ions in the thylakoid lumen to phosphorylate ADP to ATP, a process called chemiosmosis. Option 4 is correct because NADP\\u207a reductase catalyzes the reduction of NADP\\u207a to NADPH at the end of the electron transport chain, using electrons from Photosystem I. Option 3 is incorrect because carbon dioxide fixation occurs during the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle), not during the light-dependent reactions. The light-dependent reactions produce ATP and NADPH, which are then used to power the Calvin cycle.\",\n    \"difficulty\": \"Medium\",\n    \"type\": \"mcmc\"\n  }\n]",
