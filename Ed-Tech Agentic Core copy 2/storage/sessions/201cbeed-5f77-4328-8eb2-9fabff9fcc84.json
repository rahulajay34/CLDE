After training, the model parameters are \\u03b8\\u2081 = 2.5 and b = -5.0 for a single feature X (patient's blood marker level).\\n\\n(a) Calculate the probability that a patient with blood marker level X = 3.0 has the disease. Show all steps including the calculation of z and \\u03c3(z).\\n\\n(b) Based on a decision threshold of 0.5, what would be the predicted class for this patient?\\n\\n(c) The doctor mentions that the model's confidence seems \\\"borderline\\\" for this patient. Explain what this means in the context of the probability value you calculated, and discuss whether the doctor should rely solely on this prediction or seek additional tests.

The probability of 0.924 (92.4%) indicates very high confidence that the patient has the disease, not borderline confidence. A borderline case would be when \\u03c3(z) is close to 0.5 (e.g., between 0.45-0.55), where the model is uncertain. With 92.4% confidence, the model is quite certain. However, in medical contexts, even high-confidence predictions should be supplemented with additional clinical tests and expert judgment, as machine learning models can have limitations and the cost of false predictions in healthcare is high.\",\n    \"explanation\": \"This problem tests understanding of the complete logistic regression prediction pipeline and interpretation of results.\\n\\n**Part (a) - Calculation:**\\n\\nThe logistic regression model works in three steps:\\n\\n1. **Calculate z (linear combination):** z = \\u03b8\\u2081X + b\\n   - Given: \\u03b8\\u2081 = 2.5, X = 3.0, b = -5.0\\n   - z = 2.5 \\u00d7 3.0 + (-5.0) = 7.5 - 5.0 = 2.5\\n\\n2. **Apply sigmoid function:** \\u03c3(z) = 1/(1 + e^(-z))\\n   - \\u03c3(2.5) = 1/(1 + e^(-2.5))\\n   - e^(-2.5) \\u2248 0.0821\\n   - \\u03c3(2.5) = 1/(1 + 0.0821) = 1/1.0821 \\u2248 0.924\\n\\n3. **Interpret:** The probability P(Y=1|X=3.0) \\u2248 0.924 or 92.4%\\n\\n**Part (b) - Classification:**\\n\\nThe decision rule is:\\n- If \\u03c3(z) \\u2265 0.5, predict Y = 1\\n- If \\u03c3(z) < 0.5, predict Y = 0\\n\\nSince 0.924 > 0.5, the predicted class is Y = 1 (disease present).\\n\\n**Part (c) - Confidence Interpretation:**\\n\\nThis part tests critical understanding of what probability values mean in logistic regression:\\n\\n- **High confidence:** \\u03c3(z) close to 0 or 1 (e.g., < 0.2 or > 0.8)\\n- **Low/borderline confidence:** \\u03c3(z) close to 0.5 (e.g., 0.45-0.55)\\n\\nWith \\u03c3(z) = 0.924, the model is 92.4% confident the patient has the disease.
