Option 3 (570) adds all numbers instead of following the operations correctly.

Option 2 is correct: Total apples sold = 78 + 34 = 112 apples. Option 3 is incorrect: The store received 56 apples but sold 112 apples, so it sold more than it received.

Step 1: Calculate Maria's total savings. She starts with 178 dollars, receives 95 dollars from her grandmother, and earns 62 dollars from chores. Total savings = 178 + 95 + 62.
