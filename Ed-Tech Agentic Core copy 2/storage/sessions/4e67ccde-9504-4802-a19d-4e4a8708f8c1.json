Starting with 847 items, we subtract the morning sales (847 - 256 = 591), then subtract the afternoon sales (591 - 189 = 402), and finally add the new shipment (402 + 425 = 827). The correct answer is 827 items. Option 2 (1,717) incorrectly adds all numbers together. Option 3 (402) stops before adding the shipment.

The correct answer is 345. Option 2 (655) results from incorrectly calculating 1,234 - 567. Option 3 (1,111) comes from subtracting 345 from 1,456.

The correct answer is 993 cars. Option 1 (990) results from a calculation error. Option 2 (863) only adds Levels A and B.
