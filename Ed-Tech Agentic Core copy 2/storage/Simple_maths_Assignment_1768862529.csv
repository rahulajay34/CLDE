subjective,markdown,Explain the steps to solve a two-digit subtraction problem with borrowing.,,,,,,,"To solve a two-digit subtraction problem with borrowing:
1. Line up the numbers vertically, with the ones digit under the ones digit and the tens digit under the tens digit.
2. Compare the ones digits. If the bottom number is larger than the top number, 'borrow' 1 ten from the top number's tens digit.
3. Subtract the ones digits, using the 'borrowed' ten to make the bottom number smaller than the top number.
4. Subtract the tens digits, taking into account any borrowing that was done.
5. Write the final answer with the tens digit on top and the ones digit on the bottom.",,,,,,,Medium,"This response demonstrates a clear understanding of the step-by-step process to solve a two-digit subtraction problem that requires borrowing. It covers all the key steps in the correct order, providing sufficient detail to show mastery of the concept."
