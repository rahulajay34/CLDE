mcsc,markdown,A store had 347 apples in the morning. They sold 128 apples before lunch and received a delivery of 95 apples after lunch. How many apples does the store have now?,,,,,,1,,314 apples,220 apples,570 apples,442 apples,,,Medium,"Starting with 347 apples, we first subtract the 128 apples sold: 347 - 128 = 219. Then we add the 95 apples from the delivery: 219 + 95 = 314. The store now has 314 apples. Option 2 (220) incorrectly calculates 347 - 128 as 219 and rounds or miscalculates the final addition. Option 3 (570) incorrectly adds all numbers: 347 + 128 + 95. Option 4 (442) incorrectly adds 347 + 95 without subtracting the sold apples."
mcsc,markdown,"Maria had some money. She spent $45 on groceries, then earned $60 from babysitting. After that, she spent $28 on a book. If she now has $112, how much money did Maria have initially?",,,,,,1,,$125,$99,$205,$85,,,Medium,"Let's work backwards from the final amount. Maria has $112 now. Before buying the book for $28, she had: 112 + 28 = 140. Before earning $60 from babysitting, she had: 140 - 60 = 80. Before spending $45 on groceries, she had: 80 + 45 = 125. Maria initially had $125. Option 2 ($99) incorrectly calculates by subtracting instead of adding the initial grocery expense. Option 3 ($205) adds all amounts to the final total. Option 4 ($85) makes errors in the backward calculation sequence."
mcsc,markdown,"A parking lot has three sections. Section A has 156 cars, Section B has 89 fewer cars than Section A, and Section C has 43 more cars than Section B. What is the total number of cars in all three sections?",,,,,,3,,288 cars,332 cars,378 cars,421 cars,,,Medium,Section A has 156 cars. Section B has 89 fewer cars than Section A: 156 - 89 = 67 cars. Section C has 43 more cars than Section B: 67 + 43 = 110 cars. The total is: 156 + 67 + 110 = 378 cars. Option 1 (288) only adds Sections A and B. Option 2 (332) incorrectly calculates one of the section totals. Option 4 (421) incorrectly adds 89 and 43 to Section A instead of following the proper relationships.
mcmc,markdown,"A store had 45 apples in the morning. During the day, 18 apples were sold and 12 more apples were delivered. Which of the following statements are correct about the apples in the store?",,,,,,,,The store has 39 apples at the end of the day,The total change in apples during the day was a decrease of 6 apples,"If 5 more apples are sold, the store will have 34 apples",The store sold more apples than it received,"1, 2, 3, 4",,Medium,"Starting with 45 apples, we subtract 18 sold and add 12 delivered: 45 - 18 + 12 = 39 apples. Option 1 is correct. The net change is 12 - 18 = -6 apples (a decrease of 6), so Option 2 is correct. If 5 more are sold from 39, we get 39 - 5 = 34 apples, making Option 3 correct. Since 18 apples were sold and only 12 received, the store sold more than it received, so Option 4 is correct."
mcmc,markdown,"Consider the equation: 27 + x - 15 = 35. Which of the following values, when substituted for x, make the equation true?",,,,,,,,x = 23,x = 12 + 11,x = 50 - 27,x = 15 + 8,"1, 2, 4",,Medium,"To solve 27 + x - 15 = 35, we first simplify the left side: 27 - 15 = 12, so 12 + x = 35. Therefore x = 35 - 12 = 23. Option 1 gives x = 23, which is correct. Option 2: 12 + 11 = 23, which is correct. Option 3: 50 - 27 = 23, which is correct. Option 4: 15 + 8 = 23, which is correct. All options equal 23, making all four correct."
mcmc,markdown,"A parking lot has 3 sections. Section A has 28 cars, Section B has 15 fewer cars than Section A, and Section C has 9 more cars than Section B. Which statements are true?",,,,,,,,Section B has 13 cars,Section C has 22 cars,The total number of cars in all three sections is 63,Section A and Section C together have 50 cars,"1, 2, 3, 4",,Medium,"Section A has 28 cars. Section B has 15 fewer than A: 28 - 15 = 13 cars, so Option 1 is correct. Section C has 9 more than B: 13 + 9 = 22 cars, so Option 2 is correct. Total cars: 28 + 13 + 22 = 63, making Option 3 correct. Section A and C together: 28 + 22 = 50 cars, so Option 4 is correct."
subjective,markdown,"A shopkeeper had 245 apples in the morning. During the day, he sold 87 apples to customers and then received a new delivery of 156 apples. Later, he sold another 63 apples. How many apples does the shopkeeper have at the end of the day? Show all your steps clearly.",,,,,,,"Starting amount: 245 apples

Step 1: After first sale: 245 - 87 = 158 apples

Step 2: After receiving delivery: 158 + 156 = 314 apples

Step 3: After second sale: 314 - 63 = 251 apples

Final answer: The shopkeeper has 251 apples at the end of the day.",,,,,,,Medium,"This question requires students to perform multiple operations in sequence. Award full marks (5 points) for: correct final answer of 251 apples (2 points), showing all intermediate steps correctly (2 points), and clear presentation (1 point). Partial credit: 3-4 points if final answer is wrong but method is correct with minor calculation errors; 1-2 points if approach is correct but multiple calculation errors exist; 0 points if no valid approach is shown."
subjective,markdown,"Maria is planning a party and needs to calculate her budget. She has $500 saved. She spends $125 on decorations, $178 on food, and $89 on party favors. Her friend gives her $50 to help with costs. Does Maria have enough money left to buy a cake that costs $65? Show your calculations and explain your answer.",,,,,,,"Starting amount: $500

Step 1: Calculate total expenses: $125 + $178 + $89 = $392

Step 2: Subtract expenses from savings: $500 - $392 = $108

Step 3: Add friend's contribution: $108 + $50 = $158

Step 4: Compare with cake cost: $158 > $65

Answer: Yes, Maria has enough money. She has $158 remaining, which is more than the $65 needed for the cake. After buying the cake, she would still have $158 - $65 = $93 left over.",,,,,,,Medium,"This question tests the ability to perform multiple additions and subtractions and make a comparison. Award full marks (5 points) for: correct conclusion that Maria has enough money (1 point), correct calculation of total expenses (1 point), correct remaining amount of $158 (2 points), and clear explanation with all steps shown (1 point). Partial credit: 3-4 points for correct method with minor calculation errors; 1-2 points for partially correct approach; 0 points if no valid method is demonstrated."
