mcsc,markdown,Sarah has 47 marbles. She buys 28 more marbles at the store. How many marbles does Sarah have in total?,,,,,,1,,75 marbles,19 marbles,65 marbles,82 marbles,,,Medium,"To find the total number of marbles, we add the marbles Sarah already has to the marbles she bought. 47 + 28 = 75 marbles. Option 2 (19) results from incorrectly subtracting instead of adding. Option 3 (65) comes from adding 47 + 18 instead of 47 + 28. Option 4 (82) results from adding 47 + 35, which is an arithmetic error."
mcsc,markdown,A bakery had 156 cookies. They sold 89 cookies during the morning. How many cookies are left?,,,,,,2,,245 cookies,67 cookies,72 cookies,89 cookies,,,Medium,"To find how many cookies remain, we subtract the cookies sold from the original amount. 156 - 89 = 67 cookies. Option 1 (245) results from adding instead of subtracting. Option 3 (72) comes from an arithmetic error in the subtraction process. Option 4 (89) is simply the number of cookies sold, not the remaining amount."
mcsc,markdown,Marcus starts with 85 dollars. He spends 34 dollars on a book and then receives 22 dollars as a gift. How much money does Marcus have now?,,,,,,1,,73 dollars,141 dollars,63 dollars,51 dollars,,,Medium,"This problem requires two operations: first subtract the amount spent, then add the amount received. Starting with 85 dollars, subtract 34: 85 - 34 = 51 dollars. Then add the gift of 22: 51 + 22 = 73 dollars. Option 2 (141) results from adding all three numbers instead of subtracting the spent amount. Option 3 (63) comes from only subtracting 22 from 85 instead of performing both operations. Option 4 (51) is the intermediate result after spending but before receiving the gift."
mcsc,markdown,"A library has 234 books on the first shelf and 198 books on the second shelf. If 45 books are removed from the combined total, how many books remain?",,,,,,1,,387 books,432 books,279 books,189 books,,,Medium,"This problem requires combining addition and subtraction. First, add the books on both shelves: 234 + 198 = 432 books. Then subtract the books removed: 432 - 45 = 387 books. Option 2 (432) is the total before removing books, missing the final subtraction step. Option 3 (279) results from subtracting 45 from only the first shelf. Option 4 (189) results from subtracting 45 from only the second shelf instead of the combined total."
mcsc,markdown,A farmer has 125 apples. He gives 38 apples to his neighbor and 27 apples to his friend. How many apples does the farmer have left?,,,,,,1,,60 apples,190 apples,65 apples,98 apples,,,Medium,"To find the remaining apples, we subtract both amounts given away from the original total. First, add the apples given away: 38 + 27 = 65 apples. Then subtract from the original amount: 125 - 65 = 60 apples. Option 2 (190) results from adding all three numbers instead of subtracting the given amounts. Option 3 (65) is the total number of apples given away, not the remaining amount. Option 4 (98) comes from subtracting only one of the given amounts (125 - 27 = 98)."
mcmc,markdown,Which of the following expressions equal 25?,,,,,,,,15 + 10,30 - 5,20 + 5,35 - 10,"1, 2, 3, 4",,Medium,"To find which expressions equal 25, we evaluate each: 15 + 10 = 25, 30 - 5 = 25, 20 + 5 = 25, and 35 - 10 = 25. All four expressions are equivalent to 25, demonstrating that the same value can be reached through different combinations of addition and subtraction."
mcmc,markdown,Which statements correctly describe the relationship between these numbers: 42 + 18 and 50 + 10?,,,,,,,,Both expressions equal 60,42 + 18 is greater than 50 + 10,50 + 10 is greater than 42 + 18,The expressions are equal in value,"1, 4",,Medium,"Calculating each expression: 42 + 18 = 60 and 50 + 10 = 60. Since both equal 60, options 1 and 4 are correct—they both express that the expressions have equal value. Option 2 is incorrect because 42 + 18 is not greater than 50 + 10. Option 3 is also incorrect for the same reason. This question tests understanding that different addition combinations can produce identical results."
mcmc,markdown,"A store has 85 items. After selling some items and receiving a new shipment, which scenarios result in having exactly 100 items?",,,,,,,,"Sell 10 items, then receive 25 items","Sell 15 items, then receive 30 items","Sell 5 items, then receive 18 items","Sell 20 items, then receive 35 items","1, 2, 4",,Medium,"Starting with 85 items, we need a net change of +15 to reach 100. Checking each scenario: (1) -10 + 25 = +15, so 85 + 15 = 100, (2) -15 + 30 = +15, so 85 + 15 = 100, (3) -5 + 18 = +13, so 85 + 13 = 98, (4) -20 + 35 = +15, so 85 + 15 = 100. Options 1, 2, and 4 correctly result in 100 items. This tests the ability to combine subtraction and addition in a real-world context."
mcmc,markdown,Which of the following are true about the expression 75 - 30 + 20?,,,,,,,,The result is 65,"If you subtract 30 from 75, you get 45",Adding 20 to 45 gives 65,The expression simplifies to 75 - 20 - 30,"1, 2, 3",,Medium,"Evaluating 75 - 30 + 20 step-by-step: First, 75 - 30 = 45 (option 2 is correct). Then, 45 + 20 = 65 (option 3 is correct). Therefore, the result is 65 (option 1 is correct). Option 4 claims the expression simplifies to 75 - 20 - 30, which equals 25, not 65, so it is incorrect. Options 1, 2, and 3 are all true statements about the expression."
mcmc,markdown,Which operations would give you a result between 40 and 50?,,,,,,,,60 - 15,35 + 12,100 - 55,28 + 25,"1, 2, 3",,Medium,"We evaluate each operation and check if the result falls between 40 and 50: (1) 60 - 15 = 45 (between 40 and 50), (2) 35 + 12 = 47 (between 40 and 50), (3) 100 - 55 = 45 (between 40 and 50), (4) 28 + 25 = 53 (greater than 50). Options 1, 2, and 3 produce results within the specified range. This question requires students to perform both addition and subtraction, then compare results to a range."
