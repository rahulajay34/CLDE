### Detailed Walkthrough

#### What Caused the French Revolution?

The French Revolution had several key causes, all of which stemmed from the deep inequalities and injustices inherent in French society at the time:

1. **Economic Troubles**: France was facing severe economic difficulties, including high national debt, food shortages, and rising prices. This placed a heavy burden on the common people, who were already struggling to make ends meet.

2. **Social Inequality**: French society was divided into rigid social classes, with the nobility and clergy enjoying significant privileges and wealth, while the vast majority of the population (the Third Estate) had little to no political power or economic opportunity.

3. **Enlightenment Ideas**: The ideas of the Enlightenment, such as individual liberty, natural rights, and popular sovereignty, had gained widespread popularity in France. This challenged the absolute monarchy and the traditional social order, inspiring the common people to demand change.

4. **Poor Leadership**: The French monarchy, under the rule of King Louis XVI, was seen as ineffective and out of touch with the needs of the people. This eroded public trust and fueled resentment towards the ruling class.

#### The Storming of the Bastille: A Pivotal Moment

The French Revolution truly began on July 14, 1789, with the Storming of the Bastille. This iconic event was a pivotal moment that catalyzed the revolution and set it on its course.

The Bastille was a fortress and prison in Paris that had become a symbol of the King's absolute power and the oppression of the common people. On that fateful day, a large crowd of Parisians, angered by the government's refusal to address their economic and political grievances, stormed the Bastille, capturing it and seizing its cache of weapons and ammunition.

The Storming of the Bastille was a powerful act of defiance against the monarchy and a clear signal that the people were no longer willing to tolerate the status quo. It sparked a wave of revolutionary fervor that would ultimately lead to the overthrow of the French monarchy and the establishment of a new, more democratic system of government.

#### The Reign of Terror: A Brutal and Controversial Period

As the French Revolution progressed, it entered a period known as the Reign of Terror, which lasted from 1793 to 1794. During this time, the revolutionary government, led by Maximilien Robespierre, sought to purge the country of any perceived enemies of the revolution, resulting in the execution of thousands of people, including the former King Louis XVI and his wife, Marie Antoinette.

The Reign of Terror was a brutal and controversial period, marked by mass executions, political purges, and a general atmosphere of fear and suspicion. While it was intended to consolidate the revolutionary government's power and protect the revolution, the Reign of Terror ultimately undermined the revolution's ideals of liberty and equality, and led to a backlash that ultimately brought an end to Robespierre's reign of terror.

Despite its excesses, the Reign of Terror was a significant event in the French Revolution, as it demonstrated the lengths to which the revolutionaries were willing to go to defend their vision of a new, more just society. It also highlighted the challenges and complexities of attempting to radically transform a society in the midst of a political and social upheaval.
