mcmc,markdown,Which of the following are part of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis?,,,,,,,,Chlorophyll absorption,Carbon dioxide fixation,ATP synthesis,Electron transport chain,"0, 3",,Medium,The light-dependent reactions involve the absorption of light energy by chlorophyll and the subsequent electron transport chain that drives ATP synthesis.
mcmc,markdown,Which processes occur in the Calvin cycle of photosynthesis?,,,,,,,,Reduction of NADP+ to NADPH,Conversion of ADP to ATP,Carbon dioxide fixation,Electron transport,"0, 2",,Medium,"The Calvin cycle, also known as the dark reactions, involves the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH and the fixation of carbon dioxide to produce organic compounds."
mcmc,markdown,What are the main inputs and outputs of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis?,,,,,,,,"Inputs: Light, ADP, NADP+; Outputs: ATP, NADPH, O2","Inputs: CO2, H2O; Outputs: Glucose, O2","Inputs: Glucose, O2; Outputs: CO2, H2O","Inputs: ATP, NADPH; Outputs: Light, ADP, NADP+",0,,Medium,"The light-dependent reactions use light energy to produce ATP and NADPH, which are then used in the Calvin cycle to fix carbon dioxide and produce organic compounds."
mcmc,markdown,How are the light-dependent and Calvin cycle reactions of photosynthesis connected?,,,,,,,,The light-dependent reactions provide the energy and reducing power (ATP and NADPH) needed for the Calvin cycle.,The Calvin cycle provides the light energy needed for the light-dependent reactions.,The light-dependent reactions and Calvin cycle are completely independent processes.,"The light-dependent reactions produce glucose, which is then used in the Calvin cycle.",0,,Medium,"The light-dependent reactions generate ATP and NADPH, which are then used as energy and reducing power in the Calvin cycle to fix carbon dioxide and produce organic compounds."
subjective,markdown,Explain the role of light in the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. Describe the key steps and the purpose of each step.,,,,,,,"The light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast. The key steps are:
1. Light absorption by chlorophyll and other pigments in the photosystems. This excites electrons in the pigments.
2. The excited electrons are passed through an electron transport chain, generating ATP and NADPH. This process is called photophosphorylation.
3. The ATP and NADPH produced are used in the Calvin cycle to fix CO2 into organic compounds.",,,,,,,Medium,"The light-dependent reactions are the first stage of photosynthesis. They capture the energy from sunlight and convert it into the chemical energy carriers ATP and NADPH, which are then used in the Calvin cycle to produce organic molecules."
subjective,markdown,Describe the key steps of the Calvin cycle and explain how it uses the ATP and NADPH produced in the light-dependent reactions.,,,,,,,"The Calvin cycle, also known as the dark reactions or light-independent reactions, occurs in the stroma of the chloroplast. The key steps are:
1. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is fixed into organic compounds through the enzyme RuBisCO. This produces 3-carbon molecules called 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA).
2. The 3-PGA is then reduced using the ATP and NADPH from the light-dependent reactions to produce glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P).
3. The G3P can then be used to synthesize glucose and other organic compounds needed by the plant.",,,,,,,Medium,The Calvin cycle uses the energy and reducing power (ATP and NADPH) generated in the light-dependent reactions to convert CO2 into organic molecules that the plant can use for growth and development.
