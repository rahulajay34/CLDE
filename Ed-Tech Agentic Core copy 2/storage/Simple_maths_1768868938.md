# Simple Maths: Addition and Subtraction

## What You'll Learn

You'll be able to:

- Solve addition problems by combining groups
- Solve subtraction problems by taking away
- Choose the right operation for different situations
- Solve problems that use both addition and subtraction

## Detailed Explanation

### What Is Addition and Subtraction?

Think of your pocket with coins. If you start with 3 coins and someone gives you 2 more, you now have 5 coins total. That's **addition**—combining quantities to find a total. 

**Addition** is combining two or more quantities to find how many you have altogether. **Subtraction** is removing a quantity from what you have to find how many remain.

### Why It Matters

Addition and subtraction are the foundation for all mathematics that follows. Without them, you can't manage money, measure ingredients for cooking, keep score in games, or solve almost any real problem involving quantities.

Think about buying something at a store—you need to figure out your total spending by adding purchases together, or find your change by subtracting the cost from what you paid. In cooking, you combine ingredients. In games, you keep score. These operations show up everywhere numbers matter.

### Detailed Walkthrough

#### Understanding Addition: Combining and Counting On

Let's start simple. You have 4 apples. Your friend gives you 3 more apples. How many do you have now?

When you combine two groups—say 4 apples and 3 more—you need to find the total. We write this as **4 + 3 = 7**

In the equation 4 + 3 = 7, the 4 is what you started with, the + means combine, the 3 is what you're adding, and the 7 is your total.

You could count all 7 apples in front of you. Or you could start at 4 and count up 3 more: 5, 6, 7. Or imagine a number line where you start at 4 and jump forward 3 spaces. All three methods work because they're all counting the same total—just different ways to get there.

**A real-world example:** You're at a store. You buy 5 notebooks and 2 pens. How many items did you buy? You'd add: 5 + 2 = 7 items total.

#### Understanding Subtraction: Removing and Counting Back

Now you have 8 cookies. You eat 3 of them. How many cookies remain?

When you remove a quantity from what you have—say eating 3 of your 8 cookies—you need to find what's left. We write this as **8 - 3 = 5**

In the equation 8 - 3 = 5, the 8 is what you started with, the - means take away, the 3 is how many you're removing, and the 5 is what remains.

You could imagine eating 3 cookies and count the remaining ones on your plate: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Or you could start at 8 and count backward 3 steps: 7, 6, 5. Or imagine a number line where you start at 8 and jump backward 3 spaces.

**A real-world example:** You have $10. You spend $3 on lunch. How much money do you have left? You'd subtract: 10 - 3 = 7 dollars remaining.

#### The Connection Between Addition and Subtraction

Here's something powerful: addition and subtraction are opposites. They undo each other.

If you know that **4 + 3 = 7**, then you automatically know that **7 - 3 = 4** and **7 - 4 = 3**.

This is called a **number family**. Think of it like this:
- You start with 4 apples
- You add 3 more apples
- You now have 7 apples (4 + 3 = 7)
- If you remove those 3 apples, you're back to 4 (7 - 3 = 4)
- If you remove the original 4 apples, you're left with 3 (7 - 4 = 3)

The three numbers (4, 3, and 7) form a family. You can write four true equations from them:
- 4 + 3 = 7
- 3 + 4 = 7
- 7 - 3 = 4
- 7 - 4 = 3

Understanding this relationship helps you check your work. If you calculate 4 + 3 = 7, you can verify it by checking: does 7 - 3 = 4? Yes. So your addition was correct.

#### Working with Larger Numbers

The process doesn't change with bigger numbers—you're still combining or removing.

**Example: 23 + 15**

You can break this into easier pieces:
- 23 + 15
- = 20 + 3 + 10 + 5 (break each number apart)
- = (20 + 10) + (3 + 5) (group tens and ones)
- = 30 + 8
- = 38

Or you can count on: Start at 23. Count up 15: 24, 25... all the way to 38.

Or you can use the traditional method:
```
  23
+ 15
----
  38
```

Add the ones place: 3 + 5 = 8
Add the tens place: 2 + 1 = 3
Result: 38

**Example: 47 - 12**

Break it into easier pieces:
- 47 - 12
- = 47 - 10 - 2 (break 12 apart)
- = 37 - 2 (subtract 10 first)
- = 35 (subtract 2)

Or use the traditional method:
```
  47
- 12
----
  35
```

Subtract the ones place: 7 - 2 = 5
Subtract the tens place: 4 - 1 = 3
Result: 35

#### Common Mistakes and How to Fix Them

**Mistake 1: Reversing the order in subtraction**

Students often write: "I have 5 apples. I remove 3. So 3 - 5 = ?"

This is backward. The larger number (what you started with) goes first. It should be 5 - 3 = 2.

**Fix:** In subtraction, the starting amount always comes first. Ask yourself: "What am I starting with?" That number goes before the minus sign.

**Mistake 2: Forgetting what the operation means**

Students sometimes see "8 - 3" and count up instead of counting back.

**Fix:** Pause and ask: "Am I combining (addition) or removing (subtraction)?" The minus sign means remove, so count backward or take away.

**Mistake 3: Misaligning numbers when adding or subtracting**

Writing:
```
  47
+  5
----
 412  (Wrong!)
```

This happens when you don't line up the ones and tens places.

**Fix:** Always stack numbers so the ones place lines up with ones, tens with tens. Add or subtract one column at a time, starting from the right.

Correct version:
```
  47
+  5
----
  52
```

**Mistake 4: Not checking the reasonableness of answers**

A student calculates 23 + 5 = 33 and doesn't notice this is wrong.

**Fix:** Use a quick mental check. 23 + 5 should be a little more than 23. The answer 33 is way too big. Use the opposite operation: 33 - 5 should equal 23. It doesn't (it equals 28), so something's wrong. The correct answer is 28.

#### Multi-Step Problems: Combining Both Operations

Real problems often need both addition and subtraction.

**Example:** You have 12 marbles. Your friend gives you 8 more. Then you lose 5. How many do you have now?

**Step 1:** Find how many after your friend gives you marbles.
12 + 8 = 20 marbles

**Step 2:** Find how many after you lose some.
20 - 5 = 15 marbles

**Answer:** You have 15 marbles.

The key: work through one operation at a time. Each answer becomes part of the next step.

### Additional Clarity: Zero and Special Cases

**Adding zero:** Any number plus zero equals that number.
- 5 + 0 = 5
- 23 + 0 = 23

Zero changes nothing—it's the identity for addition.

**Subtracting zero:** Any number minus zero equals that number.
- 8 - 0 = 8
- 100 - 0 = 100

**Subtracting a number from itself:** Always equals zero.
- 7 - 7 = 0
- 42 - 42 = 0

You've removed everything, so nothing remains.

**Subtracting from zero:** This creates negative numbers (which you'll explore later).
- 0 - 3 = -3

For now, focus on situations where you have a starting amount to remove from.

### Tips for Building Speed and Confidence

**Memorize small combinations:** Knowing that 5 + 3 = 8 without counting saves time. Practice combinations up to 10 + 10 until they feel automatic.

**Use the commutative property for addition:** 3 + 7 is the same as 7 + 3. If one combination is hard, flip it. 3 + 7 might be easier to count up from 7 than from 3.

**Use subtraction as the inverse check:** After adding, subtract to verify. After subtracting, add to verify.

**Estimate first:** Before solving, ask "Is my answer going to be around 30? Around 50?" This catches wild mistakes immediately.

## Key Takeaways

- **Addition combines quantities:** 4 + 3 = 7 means putting together 4 and 3 to get 7 total. Use it when you need a total.

- **Subtraction removes quantities:** 8 - 3 = 5 means starting with 8 and taking away 3 to get 5 remaining. Use it when you need to find what's left.

- **They're opposites:** If 4 + 3 = 7, then 7 - 3 = 4. This relationship helps you check your work.

- **The process scales:** Whether you're adding 2 + 1 or 234 + 156, you're still combining or removing—just with more pieces to track.

- **Think of it as:** Addition is "putting together," subtraction is "taking away." Choose the operation based on what the problem is actually asking you to do.

These operations form the foundation for word problems, larger number work, and eventually multiplication and division—which are really just repeated addition and subtraction.
