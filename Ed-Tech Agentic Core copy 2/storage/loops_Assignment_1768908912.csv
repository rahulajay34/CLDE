**Iteration 1 (i = 1):**
- The inner loop runs for j in range(1), which means j takes value 0 (one iteration)
- Prints one '*'
- The outer print() adds a newline
- Output so far: `*` followed by newline

**Iteration 2 (i = 2):**
- The inner loop runs for j in range(2), which means j takes values 0, 1 (two iterations)
- Prints two '*' characters
- The outer print() adds a newline
- Output so far: `*\n**` followed by newline

**Iteration 3 (i = 3):**
- The inner loop runs for j in range(3), which means j takes values 0, 1, 2 (three iterations)
- Prints three '*' characters
- The outer print() adds a newline
- Final output: `*\n**\n***`

**Why other options are incorrect:**

- **Option 2** would require the outer loop to run 4 times (range(1, 5)), but it only runs 3 times with range(1, 4)
- **Option 3** shows a descending pattern, which would require the inner loop to decrease (like range(i, 0, -1) or similar)
- **Option 4** shows 4 lines in descending order, which doesn't match our loop structure at all

The correct answer is **Option 1** because the outer loop runs 3 times (i = 1, 2, 3), and for each iteration, the inner loop prints i asterisks on the same line."

Which of the following statements about this nested loop are correct?",,,,,,,,The outer loop executes 3 times,The inner loop executes a total of 6 times across all iterations,The code prints exactly 9 numbers in total,The last number printed is 6,"1, 2, 4",,Medium,"Let's trace through the nested loop execution step by step:

**Outer loop analysis:** The outer loop uses `range(1, 4)`, which generates values 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, the outer loop executes exactly **3 times**.

**Inner loop analysis:** The inner loop uses `range(1, 3)`, which generates values 1 and 2. This means the inner loop executes 2 times for each iteration of the outer loop. Since the outer loop runs 3 times, the inner loop executes a total of 3 × 2 = **6 times**.

**Total numbers printed:** Each time the inner loop executes, one number is printed (i * j). Since the inner loop executes 6 times total, exactly **6 numbers** are printed, not 9.

**Last number printed:** In the final iteration (i=3, j=2), the calculation is 3 × 2 = **6**, which is the last number printed.

**Correct answers:**
- **Option 1 is CORRECT:** The outer loop executes 3 times (i = 1, 2, 3).
- **Option 2 is CORRECT:** The inner loop executes 6 times total (2 times for each of the 3 outer iterations).
- **Option 3 is INCORRECT:** Only 6 numbers are printed, not 9.
- **Option 4 is CORRECT:** The last number printed is 6 (when i=3 and j=2)."

Explain how your nested loop structure works to produce this output. Include the logic for controlling both the outer and inner loops.",,,,,,,"**Program (Python example):**

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    for j in range(i):
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
```

**Explanation:**

- The outer loop runs from 1 to 5 (using `range(1, 6)`), with variable `i` representing the current row number.
- For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs `i` times (using `range(i)`).
- In each iteration of the inner loop, we print the value of `i` followed by a space.
- After the inner loop completes, we print a newline to move to the next row.
- This creates a pattern where row 1 has one '1', row 2 has two '2's, row 3 has three '3's, and so on.",,,,,,,Medium,"This problem requires understanding how nested loops work together to create patterns. The solution involves two loops:

**Outer Loop Control:**
The outer loop iterates through values 1 to 5, where each iteration represents one row of the pattern. The loop variable `i` serves a dual purpose: it determines both which number to print and how many times to print it.

**Inner Loop Control:**
The inner loop executes `i` times for each value of the outer loop. When `i=1`, the inner loop runs once; when `i=2`, it runs twice; and so on. This creates the increasing pattern.

**Print Logic:**
- Inside the inner loop, we print the value of `i` (not `j`) because we want to print the row number, not the column position.
- We use `end=' '` to print numbers on the same line separated by spaces.
- After the inner loop completes all iterations for a given row, we print a newline character to move to the next row.

**Step-by-step execution:**
- Row 1: i=1, inner loop runs 1 time, prints '1'
- Row 2: i=2, inner loop runs 2 times, prints '2 2'
- Row 3: i=3, inner loop runs 3 times, prints '3 3 3'
- Row 4: i=4, inner loop runs 4 times, prints '4 4 4 4'
- Row 5: i=5, inner loop runs 5 times, prints '5 5 5 5 5'

The key insight is that the outer loop variable controls both what to print and how many times the inner loop should iterate, demonstrating the power of nested loop coordination."
