mcsc,markdown,What is the result of 15 + 27?,,,,,,2,,36,42,48,52,,,Medium,"To find the result of 15 + 27, we add the two numbers together. 15 + 27 = 42, so the correct answer is 48."
mcsc,markdown,"If you have 35 apples and you give 12 away, how many apples do you have left?",,,,,,2,,15,23,27,35,,,Medium,"To find the number of apples left, we start with 35 apples and subtract 12 apples that were given away. 35 - 12 = 23, so the correct answer is 23 apples left."
mcsc,markdown,What is the result of 54 - 19?,,,,,,1,,25,35,45,65,,,Medium,"To find the result of 54 - 19, we subtract 19 from 54. 54 - 19 = 35, so the correct answer is 35."
mcsc,markdown,"If you have 28 pencils and you buy 11 more, how many pencils do you have in total?",,,,,,3,,28,32,39,49,,,Medium,"To find the total number of pencils, we start with 28 pencils and add 11 more. 28 + 11 = 39, so the correct answer is 49 pencils in total."
mcsc,markdown,What is the result of 72 - 45?,,,,,,3,,17,27,37,47,,,Medium,"To find the result of 72 - 45, we subtract 45 from 72. 72 - 45 = 27, so the correct answer is 47."
mcmc,markdown,What is the sum of 12 and 8?,,,,,,,,16,20,24,28,1,,Medium,"The correct answer is 20 because 12 + 8 = 20. The other options are incorrect because 16 is the sum of 8 and 8, 24 is the sum of 12 and 12, and 28 is the sum of 20 and 8."
mcmc,markdown,What are the possible results when subtracting 5 from 15?,,,,,,,,5,10,15,20,"1, 2",,Medium,"The correct answers are 10 and 15 because 15 - 5 = 10 and 15 - 5 = 15. The other options are incorrect because 5 is the result of subtracting 10 from 15, and 20 is not a possible result of subtracting 5 from 15."
mcmc,markdown,"What is the sum of 7 and 9, and the difference between 15 and 6?",,,,,,,,"16, 9","16, 21","22, 9","22, 21","0, 3",,Medium,"The correct answers are 16, 9 and 22, 21 because 7 + 9 = 16 and 15 - 6 = 9, as well as 7 + 9 = 16 and 15 - 6 = 21. The other options are incorrect because they do not correctly combine the sum and difference."
mcmc,markdown,What is the result of subtracting 12 from 20 and adding 5 to the result?,,,,,,,,13,15,17,23,"1, 3",,Medium,"The correct answers are 15 and 23 because 20 - 12 = 8 and 8 + 5 = 13, as well as 20 - 12 = 8 and 8 + 15 = 23. The other options are incorrect because 13 is the result of subtracting 12 from 20 without adding 5, and 17 is not a possible result."
mcmc,markdown,"What is the sum of 6 and 9, and the difference between 18 and 11?",,,,,,,,"15, 7","15, 29","21, 7","21, 29","0, 3",,Medium,"The correct answers are 15, 7 and 21, 29 because 6 + 9 = 15 and 18 - 11 = 7, as well as 6 + 9 = 15 and 18 - 11 = 7. The other options are incorrect because they do not correctly combine the sum and difference."
subjective,markdown,Explain the steps to solve the equation 25 + x = 45.,,,,,,,"To solve the equation 25 + x = 45:
1. Identify that the goal is to find the value of x that makes the equation true.
2. Subtract 25 from both sides of the equation to isolate x: 
25 + x = 45
x = 45 - 25
x = 20
3. Therefore, the value of x that satisfies the equation 25 + x = 45 is 20.",,,,,,,Medium,This question tests the student's ability to apply the concept of addition to solve for an unknown variable. The expected response should clearly demonstrate the step-by-step process of isolating the variable x by subtracting the known value from both sides of the equation.
subjective,markdown,Describe a real-world scenario where subtraction would be used to solve a problem. Explain the steps to find the solution.,,,,,,,"A real-world scenario where subtraction would be used is calculating the change due when making a purchase. 
For example, if the total cost of items bought is $25.75 and the customer pays with a $50 bill, the steps to find the change due would be:
1. Identify the total cost ($25.75) and the amount paid ($50)
2. Subtract the total cost from the amount paid: $50 - $25.75 = $24.25
3. Therefore, the change due to the customer is $24.25.
The key steps are subtracting the known cost from the known payment amount to determine the difference, which is the change due back to the customer.",,,,,,,Medium,"This question tests the student's ability to apply the concept of subtraction to solve a real-world problem. The expected response should describe a relevant scenario, outline the steps to solve it using subtraction, and explain how the subtraction operation is used to find the solution."
