subjective,markdown,Describe the key characteristics of agentic AI systems and how they differ from other types of AI.,,,,,,,"Agentic AI systems are characterized by their ability to autonomously make decisions and take actions in pursuit of their goals, often with a degree of flexibility and adaptability. They differ from other AI systems that are more narrowly focused on specific tasks or that operate under strict human control. Agentic AI systems may have their own internal models, decision-making processes, and learning mechanisms that allow them to navigate complex environments and respond to changing conditions.",,,,,,,Medium,"This question assesses the student's understanding of the defining features of agentic AI and how it contrasts with other AI paradigms. The model answer highlights key aspects like autonomy, decision-making, and adaptability that distinguish agentic AI."
subjective,markdown,Discuss the potential benefits and risks of deploying agentic AI systems in high-stakes domains like healthcare or finance. What ethical considerations should be taken into account?,,,,,,,"The potential benefits of agentic AI in domains like healthcare and finance include improved decision-making, faster response times, and the ability to handle large-scale, complex problems. However, the autonomous and self-directed nature of agentic AI also raises significant ethical concerns. There are risks around transparency, accountability, and the potential for unintended consequences if the AI system makes decisions that negatively impact human lives or livelihoods. Careful consideration must be given to issues like algorithmic bias, privacy, and the appropriate level of human oversight and control.",,,,,,,Hard,This question prompts the student to think critically about the tradeoffs and ethical implications of deploying agentic AI in high-stakes domains. It requires them to weigh the potential benefits against the risks and consider the key ethical principles that should guide the development and deployment of such systems.
