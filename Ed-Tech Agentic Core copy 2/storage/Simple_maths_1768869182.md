# Simple Maths: Addition and Subtraction

## What You'll Learn

You'll learn to solve addition and subtraction problems using real-world scenarios. By the end, you'll be able to quickly calculate totals and remainders in everyday situations—from managing money to sharing fairly to figuring out if you have enough.

Here's what you'll discover:

- How addition works in everyday situations you already know
- Why subtraction is just the opposite of addition
- How to use these two skills to solve real problems
- Where you'll naturally use these ideas without even thinking about it

## Understanding Simple Maths

### What Is Addition?

Think about your pocket. You start with three coins. A friend gives you two more coins. Now you have five coins total. That's addition—combining groups to find how many you have altogether.

**Addition means putting groups together and counting the total.**

When you add, you're answering: "If I have this much, and I get more, how much do I have now?"

Here's the simple pattern:
```
Start with: 3
Add: 2
Result: 5
```

### What Is Subtraction?

Now imagine you have five coins again. You spend two coins on candy. How many coins are left? Three coins. That's subtraction.

**Subtraction means taking away from a group and counting what remains.**

When you subtract, you're answering: "If I had this much and removed some, how much is left?"

Here's the pattern:
```
Start with: 5
Take away: 2
Result: 3
```

### Why Does This Matter?

**You handle money better.** If you have ten dollars and buy something for three dollars, you instantly know you have seven left. No surprises at checkout.

**You understand sharing and fairness.** When dividing pizza slices or splitting a video game controller time, addition and subtraction let you figure out who gets what fairly.

**You solve problems without asking for help.** Instead of counting on fingers every time, you can quickly figure out "Do I have enough?" or "How many more do I need?"

This is why speed matters: it frees your brain to focus on what actually matters—solving the problem, not the arithmetic.

### Core Components

**The Plus Sign (+)**
This symbol means "put together." When you see it, you're combining two groups into one bigger group.
*Example: 3 + 2 means "three things plus two things"*

**The Minus Sign (−)**
This symbol means "take away." When you see it, you're removing something from a group.
*Example: 5 − 2 means "five things minus two things"*

**The Equals Sign (=)**
This symbol means "the same as." It shows what you get after adding or subtracting.
*Example: 3 + 2 = 5 means "three plus two is the same as five"*

**Numbers**
These are the quantities you're working with. They can represent coins, cookies, friends, or anything you can count.
*Example: In 3 + 2 = 5, the numbers are 3, 2, and 5*

### How to Solve Any Addition or Subtraction Problem

When you see a problem, start by identifying what you're counting. Are you working with coins, cookies, people, or something else? Next, ask yourself: am I getting more or less? If you're getting more, you add. If you're getting less, you subtract.

Then count in the right direction. For addition, start at your first number and count up. For subtraction, start at your first number and count down. Your final count is your answer.

Here's how it works in practice: You have 7 stickers and get 3 more. You're getting more, so you add. Start at 7 and count up: 8, 9, 10. You have 10 stickers. That's 7 + 3 = 10. Or you have 10 stickers and give away 3. You're getting less, so you subtract. Start at 10 and count down: 9, 8, 7. You have 7 stickers left. That's 10 − 3 = 7.

### Putting It All Together

You're at a snack stand with eight dollars in your pocket. You buy a juice for three dollars. You're working with dollars, and you're spending money—that's subtraction. Start at 8 and count backward: 7, 6, 5. You have 5 dollars left. So 8 − 3 = 5.

Tomorrow, you get five more dollars as a gift. Now you're working with dollars again, but this time you're getting more—that's addition. Start at 5 and count forward: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. You now have 10 dollars total. So 5 + 5 = 10.

## Practice Exercises

**Real-Life Application**
Think about your day tomorrow. List three situations where you'll naturally use addition or subtraction without even realizing it. (Hint: think about meals, games, time, or belongings.)

**Pattern Recognition**
Your friend says: "I had 12 apples. Some fell on the ground and got bruised. Now I have 8 good apples." Should your friend use addition or subtraction to figure out how many fell? Why?

**Concept Detective**
You're playing a video game. Your character starts with 100 health points. You get hit and lose 25 points. Then you find a healing potion that gives you 15 points back. Is your character healthier or less healthy than when you started? How do you know?

**Spot the Error**
Your little cousin says: "I had 6 toys. I got 4 more toys. So I have 2 toys now." What went wrong? What's the correct answer?

**Planning Ahead**
Imagine you're planning a small party. You have 14 snack items. Your guests will eat about 6 items in the first hour. How many snack items will you have left? After an hour, if you bring out 8 more snack items, how many total do you have then?
