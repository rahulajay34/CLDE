mcmc,markdown,What is the difference between leading and lagging strand synthesis during DNA replication?,,,,,,,,"Leading strand is synthesized continuously, while lagging strand is synthesized in short Okazaki fragments","Leading strand is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction, while lagging strand is synthesized in the 3' to 5' direction","Leading strand is synthesized by a single DNA polymerase, while lagging strand requires multiple DNA polymerases","Leading strand is synthesized on the template strand, while lagging strand is synthesized on the newly formed strand","0, 2",,Medium,"The leading strand is synthesized continuously in the 5' to 3' direction, while the lagging strand is synthesized in short Okazaki fragments that require multiple DNA polymerases."
subjective,markdown,Explain the role of helicase in DNA replication and how it facilitates the unwinding of the DNA double helix.,,,,,,,"Helicase is an essential enzyme involved in DNA replication. It plays a crucial role in unwinding the DNA double helix, creating a replication fork where DNA synthesis can occur. Helicase uses energy from ATP hydrolysis to actively separate the two strands of the DNA molecule, breaking the hydrogen bonds between the base pairs. This creates a 'bubble' or replication fork, exposing the single-stranded DNA templates for the DNA polymerase enzymes to bind and synthesize the new complementary strands.",,,,,,,Medium,The question tests the student's understanding of the specific function of helicase in DNA replication and how it enables the replication process to proceed. The model answer provides a comprehensive explanation of helicase's role in unwinding the DNA double helix to create the replication fork.
subjective,markdown,"Contrast the roles of leading strand and lagging strand synthesis during DNA replication, and explain how DNA polymerase and Okazaki fragments are involved.",,,,,,,"During DNA replication, the leading strand and lagging strand are synthesized in different directions. The leading strand is synthesized continuously in the 5' to 3' direction, moving in the same direction as the replication fork. In contrast, the lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously in short Okazaki fragments, with DNA polymerase moving in the opposite 3' to 5' direction. Okazaki fragments are then joined together by the enzyme DNA ligase. This difference in synthesis direction is due to the inherent 5' to 3' directionality of DNA polymerase. The leading strand can be synthesized continuously, while the lagging strand requires Okazaki fragments to be synthesized in the opposite direction and then ligated together.",,,,,,,Hard,"The question tests the student's understanding of the differences between leading and lagging strand synthesis during DNA replication, as well as the roles of DNA polymerase and Okazaki fragments in this process. The model answer provides a clear explanation of these key concepts."
