Topic: {topic}
Key Concepts: {subtopics}
Prerequisites: {prerequisites}

Create pre-read content that introduces this topic to complete beginners. Structure your response naturally following this flow:

## What You'll Learn

Start with "In this pre-read, you'll discover:" then list 3-4 specific, jargon-free promises using action words (discover, understand, learn).

## Understanding {Topic}

Build awareness through these subsections—but only include ones that naturally fit. Don't force every subsection if it feels awkward:

### What Is {Topic}? (Always include)

- Begin with an everyday analogy
- Follow with one clear definition sentence
- For technical topics: show pseudo-code concept
- For non-technical: use a mini-story

### Why Does This Matter? (Always include)

- List exactly 3 benefits
- Frame as problems solved or improvements gained
- Keep explanations to 1-2 sentences each

### From Known to New (Include when helpful)

- Show the "painful way" using only prerequisites
- Introduce new concept as the elegant solution
- For code: show repetitive approach then simplified version
- For concepts: show inefficient scenario then improvement

### Core Components (Include for multi-part topics)

- Break into 3-5 main parts maximum
- Each gets: simple name + one sentence + micro-example

### Step-by-Step Process (Include for procedural topics)

- 3-5 numbered steps
- One clear action per step
- For code: minimal example per step
- For concepts: progress mini case study

### Key Features (Include only if essential)

- Maximum 2-3 features
- Only features critical for basics
- Simple example for each

### Putting It All Together (Always include)

- ONE complete example using prerequisites plus new concept
- For code: 10-15 lines maximum
- For concepts: complete mini case study with clear outcome

## Practice Exercises

Create 3-5 thinking exercises. Mix and match from:

- Pattern Recognition: Identify what could be improved
- Concept Detective: Guess purpose in examples
- Real-Life Application: List 3 situations to apply this
- Spot the Error: Find what's wrong
- Planning Ahead: How to apply concept to new situation

Important: Write naturally. Never mention the word "analogy" explicitly. Never reference "the session" or "this pre-read" in a meta way. Just teach directly.
