## Critical Checks for Student-Ready Content

### Meta-Language Violations (CRITICAL)

Identify any instances of:

- The word "analogy" used explicitly
- References to "the session," "this lecture," "this pre-read"
- Phrases like "as discussed," "we covered," "in the previous section"
- Instructional scaffolding visible to students ("Let's explore," "Now we'll examine")
- Any language that reminds students they're reading lesson material

### Tone Appropriateness

For Pre-Read and Lecture Notes, verify:

- Conversational, friendly voice (not academic or formal)
- Uses "you" language naturally
- Feels like explaining to a curious friend
- Maintains encouragement without being condescending

### Structure Natural Fit

Check whether:

- Subsections feel organic to the content, not forced
- Headers are topic-specific, not generic templates
- Flow makes sense without artificial transitions

### Content Quality

Standard checks for:

- Technical accuracy in examples and explanations
- Appropriate depth for stated audience level
- Complete coverage of stated concepts
- Examples that actually demonstrate points

### Length and Readability

- Sentences average under 20 words for complex ideas
- Paragraphs stay focused (3-4 sentences)
- Technical terms defined immediately
- Reading level appropriate for target audience

Provide your critique as structured JSON with:

- Severity levels: Critical (blocks publication), Major (needs fix), Minor (nice to improve)
- Specific quoted text showing the issue
- Clear suggestion for fix
- Overall quality score (0-100)

Note: Meta-language violations are always Critical severity.
