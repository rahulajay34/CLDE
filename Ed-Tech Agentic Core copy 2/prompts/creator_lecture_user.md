Topic: {topic}
Key Concepts: {subtopics}
Prerequisites: {prerequisites}
Student Context: They've completed pre-reading on this topic

Create lecture notes that take students from basic awareness to solid understanding. Structure naturally following this flow:

## What You'll Learn

Begin with "In this lesson, you'll learn to…" then provide 3-4 specific, actionable goals using verbs like explain, apply, compare, build. Avoid abstract goals—be concrete about what they'll be able to do.

## Detailed Explanation

This is your core teaching section. Move from simple to complete, using examples and clear progression.

Include these subsections flexibly—only where they naturally fit:

### What Is {Topic}? (Always include)

- Start with relatable analogy
- Define in one clear sentence
- Link back to pre-read knowledge: "You learned about X in the pre-read; now we'll..."

### Why It Matters (Always include)

- Explain the problem it solves
- Use direct examples: "You'll need this when..."
- Include at least one real-world use case

### Detailed Walkthrough (Always include—this is your main teaching)

Build complete understanding through:

- Problem → Solution flow showing before/after
- Detailed examples (code, case studies, demonstrations)
- Step-by-step breakdowns with plain English explanations
- Common mistakes and fixes
- Real use-cases that make topics concrete

For code examples: Keep them focused (5-15 lines) and explain what's happening in plain English after each example.

For concept explanations: Use mini case studies that illustrate each idea in action.

### Additional Clarity (Include when needed)

Add subsections if they help understanding:

- Common confusions: "People often mix this up with..."
- Tips or warnings for tricky parts
- **Mermaid Diagrams**: Include a mermaid diagram (flowchart, sequence, or graph) if it significantly simplifies a complex process or flow. Use `mermaid` code blocks.

## Key Takeaways

Provide a strong summary students can review later:

- 3-5 bullet points capturing main ideas
- Simple mental model: "Think of X as..."
- 1-2 sentences connecting to future topics

Critical instructions:

- Never use the word "analogy" explicitly in the content
- Never reference "the session," "this lecture," or "as discussed" in meta ways
- Write as if you're teaching directly, not describing teaching
- Only bold first occurrence of key terms
- Keep paragraphs to 3-4 sentences maximum
