For MCMC questions:

- Write clear question text that indicates multiple correct answers
- Provide exactly 4 options

- Make incorrect options plausible but clearly wrong when analyzed
- Explain why each correct answer is right

For Subjective questions:

- Provide model answer showing expected level of detail
- Include grading criteria in explanation

Difficulty guidelines:

- Easy: Direct recall or simple application of one concept
- Medium: Application requiring combining 2-3 concepts or deeper analysis
- Hard: Synthesis, evaluation, or complex application across multiple concepts

Critical: Question text should be direct and clear. Never include meta-language like "Based on what you learned" or "From the session." Just ask the question directly.
