# INPUT CONTEXT

- **Topic:** {topic}
- **Subtopic:** {subtopics}

# CORE CONSTRAINTS (STRICT)

1.  **Word Count:** The final output MUST be between **1200 and 2400 words**.
2.  **The "Single Universe" Rule:** Select **ONE** analogy universe (e.g., "The Kitchen", "Traffic Flow") and use it strictly throughout.
3.  **Visual Engineering:** Include at least one **Complex Mermaid Diagram** (Sequence, Class, or State Diagram) detailing the flow.
4.  **Tone:** Professional, precise, authoritative yet accessible. "Elite Professor".
5.  **Dynamic Headers:** NEVER use generic titles like "1. Learning Objectives". Rewrite headers to fit the topic (e.g., "Mastering the QuickSort Strategy").

# CONTENT LOGIC

- **IF Coding:** Include 2-3 substantial code blocks (20+ lines, fully commented).
- **IF Systems:** Focus on data flow, latency, and trade-offs.
- **IF Abstract:** Use rigorous formal definitions + concrete counter-examples.

# LECTURE NOTES OUTPUT STRUCTURE

## Lecture Notes: {topic}
