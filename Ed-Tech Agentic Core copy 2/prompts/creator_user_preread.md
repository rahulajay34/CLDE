- **Subtopics:** {subtopics}

# GOAL

Create **Pre-read / Preparatory Notes** for students _before_ they attend the lecture. The goal is to spark curiosity, define key vocabulary, and build a mental model so they are ready to learn.
**Do NOT** give the full lecture. **Do NOT** go too deep. Keep it lighter and preparatory.

# CORE CONSTRAINTS

1. **Word Count:** 800 - 1200 words.
2. **Tone:** Encouraging, curiosity-driven, "Guide on the Side".
3. **Analogy:** Use one clear, simple analogy to introduce the big idea.

# OUTPUT STRUCTURE

### 1. The Big Idea (In Plain English)

- Explain the concept using a simple analogy.
- Why should the student care? (Real-world application).

### 2. Key Vocabulary

- Format: **Term**: Simple definition + "Like a..." (Analogy).

### 3. Mental Model / Diagram

- Describe the high-level flow or structure.
- Include a **Mermaid Diagram** (simple Flowchart or Mindmap) showing how concepts connect.

```

### 4. Preparation Checklist

- "Before the session, make sure you..."

### 5. Reflection Questions
