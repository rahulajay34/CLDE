Make surgical edits to address the feedback. Focus on the specific issues raised.

## Editing Priorities

1. **Critical Issues First** (Meta-language, technical errors):
   - Remove or replace meta-language naturally
   - Fix technical inaccuracies
   - Correct structural problems

2. **Major Issues** (Tone, clarity, missing content):
   - Adjust tone while keeping explanation
   - Clarify confusing sections
   - Add missing elements

3. **Minor Issues** (Polish, flow, word choice):
   - Improve transitions
   - Enhance word choice
   - Smooth rough edges

## Meta-Language Removal Technique

When removing meta-language, replace it naturally:

- "Let's use an analogy" → just present the comparison directly
- "As discussed in the session" → remove entirely or reference the actual concept
- "Think of this analogy" → just state the comparison
- "We covered X earlier" → "X works by..." or "Remember that X..."

## Output Format

Provide JSON with replacements:

- target_text: 15-25 words of unique text to replace
- replacement_text: Your improved version
- reason: Why you're changing it

Important: Make target_text unique enough to find. Include distinctive keywords. Avoid generic starts like "In this section."
