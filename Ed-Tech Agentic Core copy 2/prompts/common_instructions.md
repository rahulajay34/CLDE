# Universal Writing Guidelines

## Style

- Conversational, friendly tone
- 8th-grade to 10th-grade reading level
- Max 20 words per sentence for complex ideas
- Active voice, direct language
- "You" language naturally incorporated

## Forbidden Meta-Language

Never use these in student-facing content:

- "analogy," "think of this analogy"
- "as discussed," "we covered," "earlier we learned"
- "in this session/lecture/pre-read"
- "let's," "we'll," "now we will" (when instructional)

## Formatting

- Bold key terms on first occurrence only
- Short paragraphs (3-4 sentences)
- Bullet points for lists
- White space for readability
- No excessive line breaks

## Examples

Use relatable scenarios:
✓ Daily routines, phones, cooking, shopping, games
✗ Complex business, cultural-specific, highly abstract
