mcsc,markdown,What is the fundamental unit of information in a quantum computer?,,,,,,2,,Bit,Qubit,Transistor,Quantum Gate,,,,"The fundamental unit of information in a quantum computer is the quantum bit, or qubit."
mcsc,markdown,What property allows a qubit to exist in a superposition of 0 and 1 states?,,,,,,4,,Entanglement,Decoherence,Quantum Tunneling,Superposition,,,,Superposition is the property that allows a qubit to exist in a superposition of 0 and 1 states before measurement.
mcsc,markdown,What is the mathematical representation of a qubit in superposition?,,,,,,1,,|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩,|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ * β|1⟩,|ψ⟩ = α + β,|ψ⟩ = α^2 + β^2,,,,"The quantum state vector of a qubit in superposition is represented as |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, where α and β are complex numbers satisfying |α|^2 + |β|^2 = 1."
mcsc,markdown,What happens when a qubit in superposition is measured?,,,,,,2,,The qubit remains in superposition,The qubit collapses into either the 0 or 1 state,The qubit is destroyed,The qubit becomes entangled with the measurement device,,,,"When a qubit in superposition is measured, the wavefunction collapses and the qubit is forced into either the 0 or 1 state, with probabilities determined by the values of α and β."
mcsc,markdown,Which quantum logic gate creates an equal superposition of 0 and 1 states?,,,,,,3,,NOT gate,CNOT gate,Hadamard gate,Phase shift gate,,,,The Hadamard gate is a common quantum logic gate that creates an equal superposition of 0 and 1 states.
mcsc,markdown,What is a key challenge in maintaining a large number of qubits in superposition?,,,,,,3,,Entanglement,Quantum Tunneling,Decoherence,Measurement Disturbance,,,,"Decoherence, where unintended interactions with the environment cause the qubit to lose its superposition, is a key challenge in scaling up the number of qubits in a quantum computer."
mcsc,markdown,How does superposition allow quantum computers to perform certain computations faster than classical computers?,,,,,,1,,By exploring multiple possibilities simultaneously,By leveraging quantum entanglement,By using less energy,By increasing the clock speed of the processor,,,,"Superposition allows quantum computers to explore multiple possibilities simultaneously, enabling them to perform certain computations exponentially faster than classical computers."
mcsc,markdown,What is the 'No-cloning Theorem' in quantum computing?,,,,,,1,,The inability to perfectly copy the state of a qubit,The inability to create an infinite number of qubits,The inability to perform quantum computations,The inability to maintain superposition indefinitely,,,,"The 'No-cloning Theorem' states that it is impossible to perfectly copy the state of a qubit, due to the measurement disturbance principle in quantum mechanics."
