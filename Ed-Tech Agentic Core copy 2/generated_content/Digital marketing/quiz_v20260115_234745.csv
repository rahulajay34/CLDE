mcsc,markdown,"In Google Ads, which component has the GREATEST algorithmic weight when calculating Quality Score?",,,,,,2,,Landing page experience,Click-through rate (CTR),Ad relevance,Historical account performance,,,,"According to the fact sheet, Quality Score weighting follows: CTR > Landing Page > Ad Relevance. CTR is the primary driver of Quality Score calculation."
mcsc,markdown,A Meta Ads campaign is in the Learning Phase. Which action should be AVOIDED during this period?,,,,,,2,,Adding more conversion events to the pixel,Cutting the daily budget to reduce costs,Testing different ad creatives,Expanding the audience targeting,,,,"The fact sheet explicitly states: 'Meta algorithm learns in first 100 conversions (Learning Phase); avoid budget cuts.' Budget reductions during Learning Phase force the algorithm to restart its optimization process, requiring 3-5 days of relearning."
mcsc,markdown,What is the primary reason a Meta Pixel may fail to optimize conversions despite being installed on a website?,,,,,,2,,The pixel is tracking PageView events only,Fewer than 50 conversions per week are being recorded,The audience is a Lookalike with 5% similarity,The bid strategy is set to Cost Cap instead of oCPM,,,,"The fact sheet lists as a common pitfall: 'Pixel not firing: Meta Pixel installed but conversions < 50/week = no algorithmic optimization.' Without sufficient conversion volume, the algorithm cannot learn effectively."
mcsc,markdown,"In Google Ads, a marketer uses the same keyword across Exact [keyword], Phrase ""keyword phrase"", and Broad match types. What is the likely consequence?",,,,,,2,,Improved Quality Score across all match types,Cannibalization of traffic between match types,Lower Cost-Per-Click due to increased competition,Enhanced Ad Rank calculation,,,,"The fact sheet identifies this as a common pitfall: 'Match type stacking: Same keyword across Exact/Phrase/Broad = cannibalization of traffic.' Overlapping match types compete for the same impressions, reducing efficiency."
mcsc,markdown,How does the Google Ads Cost-Per-Click (CPC) formula account for competitor performance?,,,,,,3,,CPC = max bid × (competitor Ad Rank ÷ your Quality Score + 0.01),CPC = bid × Quality Score ÷ competitor CTR,CPC = max bid × (competitor Ad Rank / your Quality Score + 0.01),CPC = Quality Score × competitor bid amount,,,,"According to the fact sheet, the CPC formula is: 'Cost-Per-Click (CPC): max bid × (competitor Ad Rank / your Quality Score + 0.01).' This formula ensures you pay only enough to beat the competitor's Ad Rank."
mcsc,markdown,"A Meta Ads campaign reports 28-day attribution window conversions, but the actual conversion credit is primarily based on a shorter window.

The 7-day click window is the primary attribution model for conversion credit post-iOS14 changes.
mcsc,markdown,"What is the relationship between Impression Share, budget, and keyword visibility in Google Ads?",,,,,,2,,Impression Share = impressions ÷ total searches globally (percentage of all searches),"Impression Share = impressions ÷ eligible impressions (limited by budget, bid, and eligibility)",Impression Share = clicks ÷ impressions (click-through rate indicator),Impression Share = conversions ÷ impressions (conversion efficiency metric),,,,"The fact sheet defines: 'Impression Share = impressions ÷ eligible impressions (not percentage of searches; budget/bid/eligibility limited).' Low Impression Share indicates visibility threshold issues caused by budget, bid, or account eligibility constraints."
mcsc,markdown,A marketer creates a Lookalike Audience seed from a list with less than 1% of the platform's user base and 0% conversion history. What outcome should be expected?,,,,,,3,,Excellent performance due to niche targeting precision,Strong scaling potential with rapid audience expansion,Poor Lookalike Audience model performance,Automatic algorithm optimization within 24 hours,,,,"The fact sheet identifies this as a pitfall: 'Lookalike audience seed: < 1% audience or 0% conversion history = poor model.' Additionally, 'Lookalike Seed Quality → LLA Performance (weak seed = poor scaling).' A weak seed source cannot generate a high-quality Lookalike Audience."
