mcsc,markdown,"What is the output of the following code?

```python
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(lst[-2])
```",,,,,,2,,2,4,5,IndexError,,,,"Negative indexing in Python maps -1 to the last element, -2 to the second-to-last, etc. lst[-2] refers to the element at position len(lst) - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3, which is the value 4."
mcsc,markdown,Which statement correctly creates an empty set in Python?,,,,,,2,,s = {},s = set(),s = [],s = (),,,,"{} creates an empty dictionary, not a set. The correct way to create an empty set is set(). [] creates a list and () creates a tuple."
mcsc,markdown,"What is the time complexity of accessing a dictionary value by key in the average case?

```python
d = {""name"": ""Alice"", ""age"": 30}
value = d[""name""]
```",,,,,,3,,O(n),O(log n),O(1),O(n²),,,,"Dictionaries are implemented as hash tables. Dictionary key lookup uses the hash function to directly access the value in average case O(1) time. The worst case is O(n) due to hash collisions, but average case is O(1)."
mcsc,markdown,"What will this code output?

```python
lst = [1, 2, 3]
lst2 = lst[0:2]
lst2[0] = 99
print(lst)
```",,,,,,2,,"[99, 2, 3]","[1, 2, 3]","[99, 2]",Error: cannot modify slice,,,,"List slicing creates a shallow copy. When lst[0:2] is executed, a new list [1, 2] is created. Modifying lst2 does not affect the original lst. Therefore, lst remains [1, 2, 3]."
mcsc,markdown,"Which of the following can be used as a dictionary key?

```python
d = {}
```",,,,,,2,,"[1, 2, 3]","(1, 2, 3)","{1, 2, 3}",Both A and B,,,,"Dictionary keys must be hashable (immutable). Lists and sets are mutable and unhashable, so they cannot be keys. Tuples are immutable and hashable, making them valid dictionary keys."
mcsc,markdown,"What does the following code output?

```python
d = {""a"": 1, ""b"": 2, ""c"": 3}
for key in d:
    print(key, end="" "")
```",,,,,,2,,1 2 3,a b c,"('a', 1) ('b', 2) ('c', 3)",a b c 1 2 3,,,,"When iterating over a dictionary directly, Python yields keys only, not values. To iterate over key-value pairs, you must use .items(). In this case, the loop prints the keys: a b c."
mcsc,markdown,"What is the result of the following set operation?

```python
s1 = {1, 2, 3}
s2 = {2, 3, 4}
result = s1 - s2
print(result)
```",,,,,,1,,{1},"{2, 3}","{1, 4}","{1, 2, 3, 4}",,,,"The difference operator (-) returns elements that are in s1 but not in s2. s1 - s2 = {1, 2, 3} - {2, 3, 4} = {1}. The elements 2 and 3 are in both sets, so they are excluded."
mcsc,markdown,"What is the difference between d.get(""key"") and d[""key""] when accessing a missing key?

```python
d = {""a"": 1}
```",,,,,,2,,Both raise KeyError,d.get() returns None; d[] raises KeyError,d.get() returns False; d[] returns None,No difference; both return the same value,,,,"d[""missing_key""] raises a KeyError if the key does not exist. d.get(""missing_key"") safely returns None by default without raising an error. You can also provide a default value: d.get(""missing_key"", default_value)."
