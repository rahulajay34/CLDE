mcsc,markdown,"How many times will the inner loop execute in the following code?

```js

When i=2, inner loop runs 2 times. Total: 0 + 1 + 2 = 3 asterisks. This demonstrates variable-dependent bounds (triangular iteration)."
mcsc,markdown,"What is the scope of variable `j` in this code?

Once the loop ends, `j` no longer exists outside that scope. Attempting to access it results in a ReferenceError."

mcsc,markdown,"What is the Big-O time complexity of a nested loop structure with three levels of nesting?

```js

mcsc,markdown,"What happens when `break` is executed in this code?

```js

The outer loop continues to run. For each outer iteration, the inner loop prints when j=0, then breaks when j=1, never reaching j=2."

If the goal were to accumulate across all iterations, `sum` should be declared **outside** both loops."
mcsc,markdown,"How many times will 'Hello' be printed?
